   abstract = {Background: Food safety problems still persist across the globe and remain a challenge to the general public and government. The study determined the microbiological quality of pre-cut vegetable salads sold in the Central Business District (CBD) of Tamale. Results: A total of thirty (30) salad samples were purchased from four zones of the District and transported to the Spanish Laboratory of the University for Development Studies, Ghana for analysis. Standard microbiological methods that are in accordance with American Public Health Association (APHA) were used in determining the presence and levels of bacteria in the salad samples. Escherichia coli were detected in 96.7% of salad samples with levels ranging from 0 to 7.56 log10 cfu/g. Bacillus cereus were present in 93.3% of ready-to-eat vegetable salads with counts ranging from 0 to 7.44 log10 cfu/g. Further, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were present in 73.3% and 76.7% of salads, respectively. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. counts ranged from 0 to 4.54 log10 cfu/g and 0 to 5.54 log10 cfu/g, respectively. Statistically, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Shigella spp. Contamination varied significantly (p < 0.05) across the four zones demarcated. However, Salmonella spp. contamination did not vary significantly (p > 0.05) across the zones. Conclusions: The study revealed that salads sold by street food vendors in the CBD of Tamale were unwholesome for human consumption and could be deleterious to the health of consumers. The contamination could be attributable to the source of production of the vegetables and improper food handling. It is recommended that the Food and Drugs Authority should enforce strict compliance to food quality standards at all food vending establishments in the CBD. © The Author(s). 2018.},

Post-harvest microflora differs considerably, reflecting environmental and handling conditions and might compromise the safety of the product and the consumer's health.Dipping or rinsing of vegetables in bleach solution is a common practice employed by the retailers and catering companies in order to minimize the initial bacterial load on the surface of vegetables. Rinsing or dipping vegetables in water saturated with ozone could be an alternative environmental friendly and safer process since no harmful by-products or residues are formed.Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) dipped in chlorinated water (20 ppm) resulted in 1 log decrease of the total microbial count in the first 15 min. Immersing of vegetables in water pre-saturated with ozone (0.5 mg/L) did not make any difference because the total microbial count decreased approximately 0.5 log for the same time. Sanitation treatments were most effective when vegetables were dipped in continuously ozonated (0.5 mg/L) water, leading at about 2 log of microbial load decrease in the first 15 min and 3.5 log after 30 min of exposure. The best results were achieved in the case of bell pepper, as its smooth uniform surface allows higher ozone effectiveness. Bacteria reduction kinetics in continuous ozonation trials were fitted satisfactorily by a Weibull-based model allowing a better optimization of the process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Raw vegetables can be agent of transmission of intestinal parasites. The aim of this study is to determine the parasitic contamination of salad vegetables sold at wholesale and retail markets around Ilorin metropolis. A total of 150 samples of salad vegetables obtained from five different markets were examined for both protozoa and helminth parasites using standard methods. About 25 samples each of lettuce, cabbage, carrot, cucumber, tomato and onion were examined. Eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Enterobius vermicularis, cysts of Giardia lamblia, Fasciola hepatica, Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides stercoralis, Balantidium coli and Necator americanus were detected in 28.0%, 23.3%, 11.7%, 5.0%, 6.7%, 3.3%, 10.0%, 3.3% and 8.3% respectively. Of the sampled areas, Ipata market recorded the highest parasite prevalence of 63.3% while G. R. A market recorded the lowest parasite prevalence of 13.3%. The most encountered parasite was A. lumbricoides (28.0%) while N. americanus was the least (3.3%) parasite found. The study revealed a high rate of protozoa and helminthes contamination of salad vegetables in the study areas. Parasitological contamination of raw salad vegetables sold in wholesale and retail markets in the study area may pose a health risk to consumers of such products.},

   abstract = {Botanical insecticides based on plant extracts are not widely used as crop protectants even though they can be produced simply from locally available plants. Many studies have examined efficacy but there is a paucity of information on the cost:benefit ratio of their use compared with conventional insecticides. In the present study, crude extracts of Ageratum conyzoides (Asterales:Asteraceae), Chromolaena odorata (Asterales:Asteraceae), Synedrella nodiflora (Asterales:Asteraceae), Nicotiana tabacum (Solanales:Solanaceae), and Ricinus communis (Malpighiales:Euphorbiaceae) were compared with the synthetic insecticide, emamectin benzoate (Attack (R)) against insect pests of cabbage in randomised, replicated field experiments during the major and minor rainy seasons of 2012 in Ghana. The cost of each treatment including material and labour was calculated and the revenue of each derived using the value of the marketable yield of cabbage. The cost:benefit ratios of sprayed treatments were derived by comparing the cost of each plant protection regime against the additional market value of the treatment yield above that obtained in the control treatment. With the exception of plots sprayed with N. tabacum, the cost of plant protection using Attack (R) was higher than any of the botanicals in both seasons. The highest cost:benefit ratio of 1:29 was observed for plots sprayed with C odorata and was followed closely by N. tabacum treatment with 1:25 and Attack (R) with 1:18. In the minor season, plots sprayed with Attack (R) had the highest cost:benefit ratio of 1:15 and was followed closely by N. tabacum with 1:14. Botanical insecticides differed markedly in levels of pest control and cost:benefit but some were comparable to that from conventional insecticide use whilst being produced easily from locally available plant materials and are likely to be safer to use for smallholder farmers and consumers in developing countries.

   abstract = {A field study in Valencia, Spain, was done to determine the occurrence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium on salad products that are frequently eaten raw, such as lettuces and Chinese cabbage, and in irrigation waters. Four water samples were taken weekly 1 month before harvesting the vegetables. All water samples were analyzed using techniques included in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 1623. Standard methods for detecting protozoan parasites on salad vegetables are not available. Published techniques for the isolation of parasites from vegetables generally have low and variable recovery efficiencies. In this study, vegetables were analyzed using a recently reported method for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts on salad products. The waters tested were positive for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Of 19 salad products studied, we observed Cryptosporidium in 12 samples and Giardia in 10 samples. Recoveries of the Texas Red-stained Cryptosporidium and Giardia, which were used as internal controls, were 24.5% ± 3.5% for Cryptosporidium and 16.7% ± 8.1% for Giardia (n = 8). This study provides data on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in salad products in Spain. The method was useful in the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts on the vegetables tested, and it provides a useful analytical tool for occurrence monitoring.

   abstract = {Zinc phosphide is a toxicant that is used extensively for rodent management throughout many parts of the world. Some rodent species, such as Belding's ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi Merriam, 1888), often avoid zinc phosphide grain baits, leaving green vegetation such as cabbage as the only viable carrier for rodenticides. However, to date, ambiguity has existed as to the most appropriate mixing strategy for zinc phosphide-coated cabbage baits, and it is unknown how rapidly zinc phosphide degrades on these green carriers. Following laboratory and field-enclosure trials, we detected no significant difference in mean zinc phosphide concentrations or variability in zinc phosphide concentrations between mechanical and hand mixing strategies. However, the use of a mechanical mixer was determined to be the more practical option given that it is quicker and requires less effort for mixing large quantities of bait, it minimized worker exposure to phosphine, and because it yielded mean concentrations that were closer to target values. Both the moisture content of cabbage and zinc phosphide concentrations diminished over time, resulting in a fairly minimal window of exposure for non-target wildlife. Field investigation of this exposure risk, as well as an assessment of efficacy of zinc phosphide-coated cabbage baits for Belding's ground squirrel management, are warranted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The wide use of plant-based oils and their derivatives, in particular biodiesel, have increased extensively over the past decade to help alleviate demand for petroleum products and improve the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the transportation sector. Biodiesel is regarded as a clean burning alternative fuel produced from livestock feeds and various vegetable oils. Although in theory these animal and/or plant derived fuels should have less environmental impact in soil based on their simplified composition relative to Diesel, they pose an environmental risk like Diesel at high concentrations when disposed. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the phytotoxicity of three different plant-derived biodiesels relative to conventional Diesel. For phytotoxicological analysis, we used seeds of four crop plants, Medicago sativa, Lactuca sativa, Raphanus sativus, and Triticum aestivum to analyze the germination of seeds in contaminated soil samples. The toxicological experiment was conducted with two different soil textures: sandy loam soil and silt loam soil. The studied plant-based biodiesels were safflower methyl-ester, castor methyl ester, and castor ethyl-ester. Biodiesel toxicity was more evident at high concentrations, affecting the germination and survival of small-seeded plants to a greater extent. Tolerance of plants to the biodiesels varied between plant species and soil textures. With the exception of R. sativus, all plant species were affected and exhibited some sensitivity to the fuels, such as delayed seedling emergence and slow germination (average=10 days) at high soil concentrations (0.85% for Diesel and 1.76% for the biodiesels). Tolerance of plants to soil contamination had a species-specific nature, and on average, decreased in the following order: Raphanus sativus (0-20%). >Triticum aestivum (10-40%)≥. Medicago sativa> Lactuca sativa (80-100%). Thus, we conclude that there is some phytotoxicity associated with plant-based biodiesels. Further, the findings of this study can be useful for selecting the least fuel-tolerant species as a soil contamination bio-indicator and for determining the risks of biodiesel contamination. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The vegetables are foods of great importance in the daily diet due to the nutrient content necessary for proper body functioning. The lettuce farming has been practiced in conventional and hydroponic ways, which have different characteristics in production. Lettuce is one of raw foods consumption with the highest contamination and impact on human health, causing mild diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss and anemia. The objective of this study was to compare if there is a significant difference in terms of contamination (microbiological and parasitological), in samples of lettuce from two farming types: hydroponic production and conventional production, sold in supermarkets in the city of Teresina-PI. Fifteen samples of lettuce were collected in four supermarket chains in Teresina, five conventional curly lettuces, five conventional American lettuces and five hydroponic American lettuces. The identification of total and thermo tolerant coliforms and subsequent confirmation by the biochemical evidence was performed for the presence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and protozoa. In this study were not shown significant differences of contamination considering the types of lettuce farming; however, there was a high incidence of parasitological and microbiological contaminants in lettuces from three types of farming. Out of the antibiotics tested, strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella were resistant to most antibiotics. We therefore conclude for the need to comply with current legislation and the detection of risk conditions to public health regarding the vegetables production chain from production to sale.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Consumption of minimally processed vegetables has gained popularity due to consumer emphasis on convenience and healthy eating. However, much handling during processing poses health risks to the consumers. This study was aimed at determining the proximate composition and microbiological quality of minimally processed packed fresh green salads sold in seven different retail stores in Barangay Batong Malake, Los Banos, Laguna. Methods: Proximate composition, microbiological quality and presence of filth in the sampled salads were analysed using standard AOAC, BAM and floatation methods, respectively. Results: The proximate composition of the samples in percentage consisted of carbohydrates (3.07- 14.26), protein (0.95-11.79), fat (0.03-3.64), fibre(0.64-1.13) and moisture (73.27-92.77). Microbial analysis showed a mean total plate count of 2.4 × 107and a broad range of 2.7 × 104 - 6.6 × 107 CFU/g. Most probable numbers (MPN) of >11,000/g colifonns were found in four samples and Eschen'chia wli bacteria were detected in five samples but none of the E.coli count exceeded 9.2 MPN/g. Both insect fragments and textile fibre were detected in two samples. Based on the specifications by the Food and Drug Administrations of the Philippines, the levels of contamination found could lead to imminent spoilage andpose a potential health hazard. Conclusion: Although green salads contain fibre and low calories which are nutritionally important, the present findings in a Filipino location accentuates the need for more stringent enforcement of food safety measures to protect the consumers from possible occurrence of food poisoning.},

   abstract = {The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs), organic acid (OA) salts and natamycin, a natural antifungal produced during fermentation by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis, was assessed against four pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Aspergillus niger). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of each antimicrobial (AM) was assessed to determine their efficiency on tested microbial species in order to select the most efficient. Then, the interactions between different antimicrobial compounds showing the lowest MIC were determined by the checkerboard method. The most effective antimicrobial formulation showing synergistic or additive effects was then encapsulated in an alginate matrix to protect the antimicrobial efficiency during storage. The effectiveness of the formulation was then evaluated in situ using broccoli as a food model. A combined treatment of active coating and γ-irradiation (0.4 and 0.8 kGy) was also done in order to evaluate the possible synergistic effect between treatments. The results of this study allowed the selection of 4 EOs, one OA salt and the natamycin as an antifungal agent exhibiting lower MIC values. The interactive antimicrobial effects between them showed that an antimicrobial formulation composed of 300 ppm of lemongrass EO, 5000 ppm of sodium diacetate and 80 ppm of natamycin resulted in an additive effect against A. niger, E. coli and S. Typhimurium and showing synergistic effect against L. monocytogenes. Finally, in situ analyses showed a synergistic antimicrobial activity between active coating and γ-irradiation and allowed the extension of the shelf-life of ready-to-eat (RTE) broccoli during storage at 4 °C. © 2016},

This study is being applied to the industrial wastewater that contains heavy metals. Heavy metals content can cause many effect to human health. It is important to treat the wastewater before it is discharge into the water system. Thus, a new technology based on environmental friendly and economic are required. Phytoremediation concept is the best technology to be used in order to solve the water pollutant. Phytoremediation takes advantages of plants nutrient utilization processes to in water and nutrients through roots. This study focused on the use of the root zone in order to clean up the pollutants. The length of the root being measured and the water quality is being analyzed every week for 2 months durations according to 9 parameters referred to Standard Examination of Water and Wastewater by American Public Health Associate (APHA, 2002).There are Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, Turbidity, Oil and Grease (O&amp;G), Iron (Fe), Nitrate (NO2) and Nitrite (NO3). Analysis of data was performed by using a 1-way analysis of variance (1-way ANOVA). Eichornia Crassipes sp. is the most effective among them with Fe percentage removal of 139.4% and followed by Water Lettuce at 137% and Giant Salvinia 102%. Its root zone also growth faster and continuously compare to others and proved that the contaminant is successfully absorbed by the root in order to stabilize the industrial wastewater. © 2013 AENSI Publisher All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The use of microcystins (MCs) contaminated water to irrigate crop plants represents a human health risk due to their bioaccumulation potential. In addition, MCs cause oxidative stress and negatively influence photosynthetic activities in plants. The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of MCs on photosynthetic parameters and antioxidative response of lettuce. Furthermore, the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of total MCs, MC-LR and MC-RR in the vegetable after irrigation with contaminated water was determined. Lettuce crops were irrigated for 15 days with water containing cyanobacterial crude extracts (Microcystis aeruginosa) with MC-LR (0.0, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 μg L-1), MC-RR (0.0, 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 μg L-1) and total MCs (0.0, 0.65, 2.5, 6.5 and 13.0 μg L-1). Increased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, leaf tissue transpiration and intercellular CO2 concentration were recorded in lettuce exposed to different MCs concentrations. Antioxidant response showed that glutathione S-transferase activity was down-regulated in the presence of MCs. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase activities were upregulated with increasing MCs concentrations. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of total MCs and MC-LR was highest at 6.50 and 5.00 μg L-1, respectively, while for MC-RR, the highest BAF was recorded at 1.50 μg L-1 concentration. The amount of total MCs, MC-LR and MC-RR bioacumulated in lettuce was highest at the highest exposure concentrations. However, at the lowest exposure concentration, there were no detectable levels of MC-LR, MC-RR and total MCs in lettuce. Thus, the bioaccumulation of MCs in lettuce varies according to the exposure concentration. In addition, the extent of physiological response of lettuce to the toxins relies on exposure concentrations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

This study aims to establish a method of distinguishing the geographical origin of Chinese cabbage. One hundred Chinese cabbage heads from Korea and 60 cabbage heads from China were subjected to multielement composition and strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) analyses. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio differed, based on the geological characteristics of their district of production. In addition, the content of many elements differed between cabbages from Korea and China. In particular, the difference in the content of Sr and Ti alone and the combination of Sr, Ca, and Mg allowed us to distinguish relatively well between Korea and China as the country of origin. The present study demonstrates that the chemical and Sr isotopic analyses exactly reflect the geology of the production areas of Chinese cabbage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An alternative to conventional production methods has been shown to reduce insecticide requirements, however the economic feasibility of the new system needs to be considered to facilitate adoption by farmers. Therefore, the agronomic and economic performance of an insect pest suppressive broccoli and cereal rye cover crop system was compared to a broccoli strip crop system and conventional practice (broccoli monoculture). The broccoli cover cropping system resulted in fewer leaves, smaller plants and a slightly reduced yield when compared to the other systems. Strip cropping broccoli with potatoes did not convey any agronomic advantages. Gross margin analysis revealed that on a total system basis, a 2.2% yield improvement or a 7% price premium was required to make the cover crop system perform as well as conventional practice.

   abstract = {Fresh produce is frequently contaminated by microorganisms, which may lead to spoilage or even pose a threat to human health. In particular sprouts are considered to be among the most risky foods sold at retail since they are grown in an environment practically ideal for growth of bacteria and usually consumed raw. Because heat treatment has a detrimental effect on the germination abilities of sprout seeds, alternative treatment technologies need to be developed for microbial inactivation purposes. In this study, non-thermal plasma decontamination of sprout seeds is evaluated as a promising option to enhance food safety while maintaining the seed germination capabilities. In detail, investigations focus on understanding the efficiency of non-thermal plasma inactivation of microorganisms as influenced by the type of microbial contamination, substrate surface properties and moisture content, as well as variations in the power input to the plasma device. To evaluate the impact of these parameters, we studied the reduction of native microbiota or artificially applied E. coli on alfalfa, onion, radish and cress seeds exposed to non-thermal plasma in an atmospheric pressure pulsed dielectric barrier discharge streamed with argon. Plasma treatment resulted in a maximum reduction of 3.4 logarithmic units for E. coli on cress seeds. A major challenge in plasma decontamination of granular food products turned out to be the complex surface topology, where the rough surface with cracks and crevices can shield microorganisms from plasma-generated reactive species, thus reducing the treatment efficiency. However, improvement of the inactivation efficiency was possible by optimizing substrate characteristics such as the moisture level and by tuning the power supply settings (voltage, frequency) to increase the production of reactive species. While the germination ability of alfalfa seeds was considerably decreased by harsh plasma treatment, enhanced germination was observed under mild conditions. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that cold plasma treatment represents a promising technology for inactivation of bacteria on seeds used for sprout production while preserving their germination properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Soybean sprouts are vegetables for direct consumption obtained from germinated grains, which have been used for centuries in Eastern countries. Their nutritional characteristics and ease of production have attracted the attention of consumers from Western countries. Small seeds with high germinating power and vigour are inherent qualities for shoot production. At the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation -Embrapa, these characteristics have been considered in the genetic breeding program to obtain special soybean cultivars for human consumption. The aim of this study was to produce and characterize the quality of soybean sprouts from the genetic lines BRM09-10505, BRM10-60599 and PF133002, in comparison with the cultivar BRS 216, which was developed for use as sprouts and natto. Trays placed in a growth chamber (25 °C and 99% relative humidity) were used for produce the sprouts. The protein, lipid, ash, isoflavones, Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid contents were analysed in the seeds and sprouts. The length and weight of the sprouts were also determined. Seeds of the line BRM09-10505 showed 95% germinating power followed by BRS 216 (93%) and the other lines (88% on average). Germination, by mobilizing chemical compounds, increased the protein (8.96%) and isoflavone (56.00%) contents, and reduced the concentrations of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (26.91%) and phytic acid (13.78%). The cultivar BRS 216 presented the highest protein content in the seeds (41.96 g.100 g-1) and sprouts (47.70 g.100 g-1). The line BRM09-10505 had the highest trypsin inhibitor content in the seeds (27.56 mg IT g-1) and in the sprouts (19.62 mg IT g-1); the highest total isoflavone contents in the seeds (340.10 mg.100g -1) and in the sprouts (406.38 mg.100 g-1); and the lowest phytic acid content in the sprouts (1.13 g. 100 g-1). After four days of germination, the length and weight of the sprouts were, respectively, 8.03 cm and 214.36 g for line BRM09-10505 and 7.31 cm and 140.93 g for BRS 216. Of the lines tested, BRM09-10505 showed good potential for sprout production.},

The salads were mainly baby leaf of single species (lettuce, arugula, spinach, lamb's lettuce), with approximately 10% of the lots made up by mixes of 2-4 species. One unit per lot was analyzed on the day of collection and the other at the consume-by date. No Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes was found (detection limit: presence in 25 g). Escherichia coli was detected in 27% of the lots (detection limit: 5 cfu/g), with probability of occurrence and counts highest in Autumn and for lettuce and arugula. Average visual quality was higher and other components of the microbial load were lower in Winter and Spring compared to Summer and Autumn (-0.6 log cfu/g of total aerobic counts, -1.3 log cfu/g of coliforms, -0.6 log cfu/g of yeasts and moulds). Lactic acid bacteria were detected more frequently in Spring and Summer (up to 50% of the lots). The rate of increase of microbial populations during shelf life was not affected by the level of initial contamination. At the consume-by date total aerobic count exceeded 7.2 log cfu/g for 50% of the lots and 7.7 log cfu/g for 25%. Salads from the biggest processor and retailer showed slightly higher visual quality scores, lower odds of E. coli occurrence and lower microbial loads. Visual quality scores showed significant negative relationships with the levels of lactic acid bacteria, coliforms and total viable counts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The role of ready-to-eat products as a reservoir of pathogenic species of Acinetobacter remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of Acinetobacter species in lettuces and fruits marketed in Portugal, and their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 77.9% of the samples and these microorganisms were also found as endophytes (i.e. present within the plant tissue) in 12 of 20 samples of lettuces analysed. Among 253 isolates that were identified as belonging to this genus, 181 presented different PFGE profiles, representing different strains. Based on the analysis of the partial sequence of rpoB, 175 strains were identified as members of eighteen distinct species and the remaining six strains may represent five new candidate species since their rpoB sequence similarities with type strains were less than 95%. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter johnsonii were the most common species, both with the frequency of 26.5%; and 11% of the strains belong to the Acinetobacter baumannii group (i.e. A. baumannii, Acinetobacter pittii, Acinetobacter seifertii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis), which is most frequently associated with nosocomial infections. Overall, the strains were least susceptible to piperacillin (80.1%), piperacillin-tazobactam (64.1%), ceftazidime (43.1%), ciprofloxacin (16.6%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14.9%), imipenem (14.4%) and colistin (13.3%). The most active antimicrobials were minocycline and tetracycline, with 0.6% and 3.9% of strains resistant, respectively. About 29.8% of the strains were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR), 4.4% as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and the prevalence of MDR strains within the A. baumannii group (25%) was similar to other species (30.4%). The presence of clinically important species as well as MDR strains in lettuces and fruits may be a threat to public health considering that they may transmit these pathogens to environments such as the community and hospital settings.

This study evaluated those risk factors and described, for the first time, the distribution of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, coliforms, and Enterobacteriaceae) and the prevalence of foodborne pathogens (Enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) in baby spinach grown in the Southeast of Spain. A longitudinal study was conducted on three farms (2011-2013). Results obtained for E.coli highlighted soil and irrigation water as important factors affecting the microbial safety of baby spinach. Significant differences in the proportion of E.coli positive samples were found between treated (46.1%) and untreated (100%) irrigation water. However, the microbial quality of irrigation water didn't affect E.coli prevalence in produce. All E.coli positive spinach samples were detected at the highest observed temperature range suggesting that ambient temperature affects the probability and extent of spinach contamination. Salmonella spp. was detected by RT-PCR in manure, soil, irrigation water and baby spinach but only two of them (manure and irrigation water) were confirmed by isolation in culture media. Salmonella RT-PCR positive samples showed higher levels of E.coli than Salmonella negative samples. This preliminary finding supports recent identification of E.coli as a suitable parameter for the hygiene criterion at the primary production of leafy greens. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

To deal with these concerns, food safety management systems (FSMS) that are tailored to specific company situations are needed. However, the context of the production, processing and trade chains influence the FSMS. The objective of this study was to gain insights into the food safety context of fresh produce production and processing companies located in southeastern Spain, a leading European horticultural area. A diagnostic tool was applied in 13 producer and 7 processing companies focused on the trade of fresh-cut leafy greens throughout the Eu. The diagnostic tool consisted of a questionnaire about the context of the company and its risk profile. Results showed that product and process riskiness were moderate to high for most of the companies surveyed. All the companies in this study complied with voluntary standards such as GLOBAL GAP, BRC and IFS. Multiple certification requirements are forcing these companies to develop a generic sector-based FSMS adapted to their situations.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess selected bioassays and ecological screening tools for their suitability in a weight of evidence risk screening process of acidic metal contaminated soil. Intact soil cores were used for the tests, which minimizes changes in pH and metal bioavailability that may result from homogenization and drying of the soil. Soil cores were spiked with ZnCl 2 or CaCl 2. Leachate collected from the soil cores was used to account for the exposure pathways through pore water and groundwater. Tests assessed included MetSTICK in soil cores and Microtox in soil leachate, lettuce (Lactuca sativa), red fescue (Festuca rubra) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) in the soil cores and lettuce and red clover in soil leachate, Hyallella azteca in soil leachate, and an ecological soil function test using Bait Lamina in soil cores. Microtox, H. azteca, lettuce and red fescue showed higher sensitivity to low pH than to Zn concentrations and are therefore not recommended as tests on intact acidic soil cores and soil leachate. The Bait Lamina test appeared sensitive to pH levels below 3.7 but should be investigated further as a screening tool in less acidic soils. Among the bioassays, the MetSTICK and the T. pratense bioassays in soil cores were the most sensitive to Zn, with the lowest nominal NOEC of 200 and 400mg Zn/kg d.w., respectively. These bioassays were also tolerant of low pH, which make them suitable for assessing hazards of metal contaminated acid soils. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Interactions with free-living protozoa (FLP) have been implicated in the persistence of pathogenic bacteria on food products. In order to assess the potential involvement of FLP in this contamination, detailed knowledge on their occurrence, abundance and diversity on food products is required. In the present study, enrichment and cultivation methods were used to inventory and quantify FLP on eight types of commercial vegetable sprouts (alfalfa, beetroot, cress, green pea, leek, mung bean, red cabbage and rosabi). In parallel, total aerobic bacteria and Escherichia coli counts were performed. The vegetable sprouts harbored diverse communities of FLP, with Tetrahymena (ciliate), Bodo saltans and cercomonads (flagellates), and Acanthamoeba and Vannella (amoebae) as the dominant taxa. Protozoan community composition and abundance significantly differed between the sprout types. Beetroot harbored the most abundant and diverse FLP communities, with many unique species such as Korotnevella sp., Vannella sp., Chilodonella sp., Podophrya sp. and Sphaerophrya sp. In contrast, mung bean sprouts were species-poor and had low FLP numbers. Sampling month and company had no significant influence, suggesting that seasonal and local factors are of minor importance. Likewise, no significant relationship between protozoan community composition and bacterial load was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We developed a risk assessment of human salmonellosis associated with consumption of alfalfa sprouts in the United States to evaluate the public health impact of applying treatments to seeds (0–5-log10 reduction in Salmonella) and testing spent irrigation water (SIW) during production. The risk model considered variability and uncertainty in Salmonella contamination in seeds, Salmonella growth and spread during sprout production, sprout consumption, and Salmonella dose response. Based on an estimated prevalence of 2.35% for 6.8 kg seed batches and without interventions, the model predicted 76,600 (95% confidence interval (CI) 15,400–248,000) cases/year. Risk reduction (by 5- to 7-fold) predicted from a 1-log10 seed treatment alone was comparable to SIW testing alone, and each additional 1-log10 seed treatment was predicted to provide a greater risk reduction than SIW testing. A 3-log10 or a 5-log10 seed treatment reduced the predicted cases/year to 139 (95% CI 33–448) or 1.4 (95% CI &lt;1–4.5), respectively. Combined with SIW testing, a 3-log10 or 5-log10 seed treatment reduced the cases/year to 45 (95% CI 10–146) or &lt;1 (95% CI &lt;1–1.5), respectively. If the SIW coverage was less complete (i.e., less representative), a smaller risk reduction was predicted, e.g., a combined 3-log10 seed treatment and SIW testing with 20% coverage resulted in an estimated 92 (95% CI 22–298) cases/year. Analysis of alternative scenarios using different assumptions for key model inputs showed that the predicted relative risk reductions are robust. This risk assessment provides a comprehensive approach for evaluating the public health impact of various interventions in a sprout production system. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis},

The effects of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a fast releaser of H2S, on cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var botrytis L. cv. Xiahua 60 d) seed germination and seedling growth under lead acetate stress were investigated in the present study. Pb (0.25 and 0.5 mM) stresses markedly inhibited seed germination and seedling growth, whereas the inhibition was effectively mitigated by NaHS application. Germination percentage, root length, shoot length, and fresh weight of single seedling significantly increased. In addition, NaHS elevated endogenous H2S contents and reduced malonyldialdehyde, superoxide anion (O 2· -), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, thereby preventing oxidative damage from Pb or Pb and antioxidant enzyme inhibitor (diethyldithiocarbamate or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) dual stresses. The protective roles of NaHS were equivalent to the ROS scavengers, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid? and N,N′-Dimethylthiourea. Moreover, NaHS elevated non-protein thiols and total glutathione levels to chelate Pb or scavenge ROS directly. Our results demonstrated the strong protective and antioxidant roles of H2S. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {In 2006, after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traced Escherichia coli O157:H7 cases to spinach, the FDA went beyond communicating with consumers and enlisted the cooperation of the food industry to prevent further spinach consumption. Understanding the factors that increased or frustrated industry participation provides lessons for communicating about accidental contamination and intentional attacks on the American food supply. This qualitative research about FDA's risk communication included interviews with senior representatives of organizations serving a range of roles in the food supply system, including suppliers, distributors, grocery stores, and trade associations. The interviews reveal that when public health concern is no longer warranted, agencies need to develop and disseminate "closure" messages to prevent unintended consequences, including economic impacts. The study also underscores the importance of trade associations and industry networks in protecting consumers, the usefulness of agency flexibility in increasing cooperation with stakeholders, and the need for greater communication among agencies. Outside the geographic epicenter of the contamination, New Jersey government also provided examples of innovative strategies to promote locally grown spinach. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Most of the decontamination treatments increased germination, decreased microbial load and enhanced sprout growth. Ultrasonication and NaOCl treatments reduced total aerobic counts on sprouts by 5.86 and 5.51 log units (averages of three varieties), respectively; while other chemical treatments (350 mL L-1 ethanol, 350 mL L-1 vinegar and 10 g L-1 NaCl solutions) failed to reduce total aerobic counts sufficiently enough to secure microbial safety. The ultrasonication not only improved germination (increased from an average of 83 to 97%), but also reduced the total aerobic counts to 2.21 log(10) CFU g(-1) on seed sprouts. Ultrasonication also increased the sprouts yield to 301.83 g per 10 g seeds. Therefore, ultrasonication can be used as a microbial control treatment for pea sprout production.},

Its effect on the shelf-life extension of fruit-based salads, romaine hearts, and pork slices were investigated as well. Three types of GTEs from hot water (80°C) (W), 40% (E4) and 80% (E8) ethanol were prepared. It was found that all GTEs showed pronounced inhibition on Gram positive bacteria in agar media, including Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 10781, Bacillus cereus BCRC 11778 and Listeria monocytogenes BCRC 14848, but not on Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli DH10β and Salmonella enteria BCRC 10747. The antimicrobial activities increased with increasing GTEs concentration (1, 2 and 5%), but did not differentiate significantly in terms of the effect of extraction solvents. When various GTEs (1%) were added to an edible coating formulation based on 1.35% tapioca starch +. 0.15% dHG +. 0.225% glycerol, pronounced antimicrobial activity on Gram positive bacteria was also observed as evaluated by using cylinder diffusion and antimicrobial migration tests. It was believed that the active compounds in green tea extracts could leave the coating matrix and migrate to increase the non-growth area. When being sprayed on various real food models, all tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs could successfully reduce the aerobic counting and growth of yeasts/molds by 1 to 2 log cycles in fruit-based salads, as compared to the control sample. Furthermore, during refrigerated storage of romaine hearts and pork slices for 48. h, tapioca starch/dHG coatings with E4 extracts demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (4-6 log cycles reduction), followed by W extracts and E8 extracts in a decreasing order. Such results implied the high efficacy of antimicrobial migration of tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs and their application potentials on foods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Multiple foodborne illness outbreaks have been associated with the consumption of fresh produce. Investigations have indicated that microbial contamination throughout the farm-to-fork continuum often contributed to these outbreaks. Researchers have hypothesized that handling practices for leafy greens in restaurants may support contamination by and proliferation and amplification of pathogens that cause foodborne illness outbreaks. However, limited data are available on how workers handle leafy greens in restaurants. The purpose of this study was to collect descriptive data on handling practices of leafy greens in restaurants, including restaurant characteristics, types of leafy greens used, produce receipt, and food safety training and certification. As a federal collaborative partner with the Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that EHS-Net participants survey handling practices for leafy greens in restaurants. The recommendations in the FDA's Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards of Leafy Greens are significant to this study for comparison of the results. The survey revealed that appropriate handling procedures assist in the mitigation of other unsafe handling practices for leafy greens. These results are significant because the FDA guidance for the safe handling of leafy greens was not available until 2009, after the survey had been completed. The information provided from this study can be used to promote additional efforts that will assist in developing interventions to prevent future foodborne illness outbreaks associated with leafy greens.},

   abstract = {The Foodborne Diseases syndromes are caused by the ingestion of food and / or water containing etiologic agents in such quantities that affect the health of the consumer. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of parasites, bacteria total coliform and fecal samples of lettuce and mussels sold in a public market Maceió-AL. 13 feet of lettuce and 20 samples of mussels that were collected from different boxes and individually wrapped in sterile plastic bags were evaluated. For parasitological analysis, the samples were weighed mussels and lettuce (50g) subsequently subjected to manual washing with 300 ml of distilled water. Then, the wash water was collected in an appropriate container, and this was analyzed by two techniques for detection of parasites: single spontaneous sedimentation and centrifugation. For microbiological analysis of samples of lettuce and mussels to the most probable number was used, using broth Lauryl Sulfate Tryptose presumptive test, bright green soup and broth Escherichia coli for the confirmatory test. Among the samples, 84.39 % were larvae Rhabdiasidae family, and 15.61 % of samples were negative, parasitic structures were not identified in the assessed mussels. Microbiological analysis in all samples of lettuce and mussels presented with results of > 1100 MPN / g for coliform bacteria indicates that these products have high microbiological contamination and should not be ingested by children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. These data indicate the need for guidance as to the hygiene of food handlers in the preparation of lettuces and mussels by consumers. © 2015, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

   abstract = {This project was undertaken to relate what is known about the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 under laboratory conditions and integrate this information to what is known regarding the 2006 E. coli O157:H7 spinach outbreak in the context of a quantitative microbial risk assessment. The risk model explicitly assumes that all contamination arises from exposure in the field. Extracted data, models, and user inputs were entered into an Excel spreadsheet, and the modeling software @RISK was used to perform Monte Carlo simulations. The model predicts that cut leafy greens that are temperature abused will support the growth of E. coli O157:H7, and populations of the organism may increase by as much a 1 log CFU/day under optimal temperature conditions. When the risk model used a starting level of 21 log CFU/g, with 0.1% of incoming servings contaminated, the predicted numbers of cells per serving were within the range of best available estimates of pathogen levels during the outbreak. The model predicts that levels in the field of 21 log CFU/g and 0.1% prevalence could have resulted in an outbreak approximately the size of the 2006 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This quantitative microbial risk assessment model represents a preliminary framework that identifies available data and provides initial risk estimates for pathogenic E. coli in leafy greens. Data gaps include retail storage times, correlations between storage time and temperature, determining the importance of E. coli O157:H7 in leafy greens lag time models, and validation of the importance of cross-contamination during the washing process.

   abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food-producing sector and represents around 40% of global fish production. Doubtless, aquaculture will be soon the main world source of marine and freshwater food, over the capture fishery. Water pollution is a main concern for production and represents a public health risk. Cruciferous vegetables, as broccoli, have been reported to have a chemoprotection capacity against the effect of pollutants on different organisms. Broccoli and its phytochemicals are able to modulate the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) which are involved in the xenobiotic metabolism. In this work, the effect of a broccoli-rich diet on different cytochromes P450 activities in liver from tilapia juveniles exposed to phenol was determined. Activities on phenacetin, chlorzoxazone, tolbutamide, mephenytoin, dextromethorphan, and testosterone, were monitored in tilapia liver extracts from fish fed with and without enriched broccoli diets, before and after phenol exposure. Fish were fed with broccoli and control diets during 30 days prior to phenol exposure at two sub-lethal concentrations of phenol (2 and 20 mg L-1), then the profile of CYP activities was determined at 0, 12 and 24 h after phenol addition. Before phenol addition fish fed with broccoli-rich diet showed a significant induction of phenacetin and tolbutamide activities when compared with liver extracts from fish fed with control diet. After phenol exposure a clear and steady induction of the dextromethorphan and mephenytoin activities were detected. In spite of the fact that substrates are not specific for each CYP, the increase of activity on dextromethorphan could represent the first report of a hepatic CYP2D6 induction by the presence of a xenobiotic. In addition, phenol exposure through diet was evaluated. Consistently with the previous experiments, phenacetin and chlorzoxazone showed higher activities while dextromethorphan and testosterone activities were lower in the liver extract from fish fed with broccoli than in control fish. Interestingly, tolbutamide activity was significantly higher in fish fed with broccoli than these observed in the controls, while mephenytoin showed 8-times higher activity in fish fed with control diet than those fed with broccoli enriched diet. The role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the xenobiotic metabolism and the potential use of designed diets, containing chemoprotectors, to contend against pollutant effects on cultivated fish are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The contamination of food, water, and soils by herbicides, as well as the growing resistance of weeds to these products, has increased demands for alternative methods of weed control that have less impact on the environment and human health. Curcuma zedoaria (zedoary), a species of the Zingiberaceae family, is a promising plant for alternative weed control as it produces an essential oil with herbicidal action. We evaluated the chemical composition of C. zedoaria essential oil and its allelopathic effects on the vigor and germination of lettuce achenes and tomato seeds. The essential oil was extracted from the plant rhizome by hydrodistillation and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify its component chemical compounds. Bioassays to evaluate allelopathic potential were performed in gerbox-type containers maintained in a refrigerated biochemical oxygen demand incubator at 25°C. The treatments consisted of five essential oil concentrations (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00%) and two bioindicators (lettuce and tomato). C. zedoaria essential oil comprises monoterpene hydrocarbons (4.63%), oxygenated monoterpenes (25.88%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (21.95%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (47.54%). The major compounds encountered were 1.8-cineole (15.75%) and epi-curzerenone (18.20%). We believe that the isolated effect of these compounds or the synergism between them may have influenced the observed results. Germination was inhibited in both bioindicator species, but the percentage inhibition was greater in lettuce achenes. Germination rates decreased in lettuce and tomato with increasing concentrations of essential oil, and bioindicator growth was slowed. The root system was more heavily damaged than the hypocotyl, especially in tomato compared to lettuce. These preliminary results indicate that C. zedoaria essential oil has allelopathic effects on seed germination and seedling growth and thus shows potential for weed control.},

A total of 493 individuals answered a questionnaire composed of demographic and socioeconomic questions and, preparing, storage and consumption practices of HMS. The level of good hygiene practices (GHP) of respondents was calculated using Good Practice and Outbreak Prevention Indexes. The consumer behavior and the correlation between practices were performed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). 75% of respondents consume HMS, being 43% of interviewers doing this at least once per month. HMS was prepared from 30 min to 1 h before being served by 46% of individuals, it remaining for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature during the meal by 63% of people. Furthermore, 51% of respondents left the HMS container open or improperly closed, which may lead to cross-contamination. Most respondents (66%) stated reuse the HMS for less than one day (44%), at once (76%). 77% of participants declared that they prepare HMS, being only 7% preparing HMS without eggs. The majority (51%) used a cooked and a raw egg yolk. In addition, 75% of the cases showed raw eggs in recipe. The Weighted Good Practice Index, Weighted Outbreak Prevention Index and Weighted Harmonic Outbreak Prevention Index were 63%, 62% and 27% of participants, respectively. The MCA gathered the participants into two groups one commits various errors and other commits few errors on GHP. Thus, a consumer would probably perform multiple either good or bad practices simultaneously. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study evaluated the distribution of generic E. coli and the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in two different water sources (ponds and streams bordering farmlands and urban areas) used for irrigation and on commercially produced lettuces in Southern Brazil. We also evaluated the effect of agricultural factors and meteorological conditions in the potential contamination of water and produce samples. A longitudinal study was conducted on four farms during a year (July 2014 to August 2015). The results showed generic E. coli prevalence of 84.8% and 38.3% in irrigation water samples and on lettuces, respectively, indicating irrigation water as an important source of contamination of lettuces. No significant differences were detected in the counts of E. coli between the two different surface water sources. The climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and environmental temperature, have influenced the high concentration of E. coli. The highest loads of E. coli in irrigation water and on lettuces were found during the warmest time of the year. E. coli O157:H7 was detected by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 13 water samples but only 4 were confirmed by isolation in culture media. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Microbial contamination of sprouts by Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been a common cause of foodborne diseases and a continuing challenge to the sprout industry. Seed disinfection treatment has been recommended as a major intervention step in a multihurdle approach to reduce the risk of illness associated with contaminated sprouts. U.S. Food and Drug Administration cited 20000 ppm calcium hypochlorite as an example treatment in its recommendation for seed treatment and this treatment has been considered the reference standard for seed disinfection treatment for over a decade. However, promising new disinfection treatments have emerged in recent years. In this study, we summarized published data and compared the efficacies of different disinfection methods in the reduction of microbial contamination on seeds. Our findings suggest that while biological interventions such as competitive exclusion and certain chemical treatments appear to be similar to 20000 ppm calcium hypochlorite for seed disinfection, physical methods especially high pressure may be more effective than the reference standard regardless of the type of bacteria or seed. The combination of 2 or more treatments, sequentially or simultaneously, may further improve disinfection results. Since treatments with high levels of chemical disinfectants, especially 20000 ppm calcium hypochlorite, can pose environmental and worker safety risks, alternative intervention approaches should be considered. Additional studies to confirm the greater efficacy of certain physical and combined seed disinfection treatments and to identify other effective management strategies are needed to further improve sprout safety. © 2013 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

   abstract = {A study was carried out to determine the food safety status of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) harvested from rural streams under Maori protocol. Sixty-five sample bunches (c. 500 g) were collected from four streams in the Waikato region of New Zealand each summer from 2005 to 2007. Two streams, Southern Enclosure and Te Waihou, were within reserves and the other two, Mangapiko and Piopio, flowed through pastoral farms. To assess faecal contamination status, Escherichia coli and thermotolerant Campylobacter were measured on watercress as collected and E. coli counts assessed against the New Zealand guideline for ready-to-eat foods (satisfactory: <3 E. coli per g). To determine whether washing would ensure the watercress met food safety standards, an additional 6 bunches were collected and washed in running tap water (household regime). A further 15 bunches were washed by a simulated commercial triple washing regime. At harvest, 16 of 17 watercress samples collected from the Southern Enclosure and 11 of 22 from Te Waihou met the satisfactory criterion for ready-to-eat food, but only 1 of 17 from Mangapiko and none of 9 from Piopio were satisfactory. No Campylobacter was recovered from any sample of watercress collected from the four sites. After washing in running tap water, E. coli numbers still exceeded the satisfactory criterion. Commercial triple washing was more effective in ensuring satisfactory watercress, but of the 15 samples subjected to this regime, only 6 met the satisfactory criterion. Escherichia coli remained firmly attached to watercress leaves after both washing regimes (presumably in biofilms). Overall, these findings suggest that it is not advisable to use watercress harvested from rural streams as a raw salad vegetable, particularly from those affected by pastoral farming.},

   abstract = {Foodborne illnesses associated with fresh produce continue to be a major concern as consumer demand for healthier and nonthermally processed food increases. The objective of this study was to evaluate vaporized ethyl pyruvate (EP; CAS 617-35-6) as a safe alternative antimicrobial agent for the decontamination of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on green onions and spinach. Baby spinach leaves and green onions were inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7 (pGFP) by the dipping method. Samples were treated with concentrations of 0, 42, 105, and 420 mg/liter vaporized EP in a 2.6-liter enclosed container. The efficacy of EP vapors for reducing E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) populations on green onions and baby spinach at 4 and 10 degrees C was monitored for 7 and 5 days, respectively. The lowest EP concentration (42 mg/liter) resulted in 1.7-log reduction of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) on green onions after 7 days at 4 degrees C and a 1.9-log reduction after 5 days at 10 degrees C (P < 0.05). In baby spinach, the same concentration resulted in 0.9-log and 1.4-log reductions (P < 0.05) of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) after 7 days at 4 degrees C and 5 days at 10 degrees C, respectively. On green onions, the highest concentration of EP (420 mg/liter) reduced the population of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) by >4.7 log CFU/g after 7 days at 4 degrees C and 5 clays at 10 degrees C. The same concentration was also effective for reducing E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) populations in baby spinach by 4.3 log CFU/g after 7 days at 4 degrees C and by >6.5 log CFU/g after 3 days at 10 degrees C. Although the successful EP treatments minimally affected the sensory attributes of green onions, the treatments resulted in significant changes in the sensory attributes of baby spinach samples stored at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results indicate that EP is an effective antimicrobial that could be used to enhance the safety of fresh produce depending on the sensory characteristics of the product.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine the microbiological quality of home meals and salads samples. Methodology: A total of 180 samples were collected between May 2007 and July 2007 in Ankara, Turkey. The samples were analysed for the presence of total aerobic bacteria (TAB), thermotolerant coliform bacteria (TCB), Esherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Results: In the present study, S.aureus, coliforms, E.coli, and Salmonella were not detected in cooked meat meals samples. TAB was detected in 22 (24.4%) meat dishes ranges 102-104. The cooked meat dishes samples were analyzed for the presence of TCB, and detected in 2 (2.2%) meat dishes ranges 103-104. Numbers of the aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged from 102 to 105 cfu/g and coliforms from 37 to 1400 MPN/g in 17 (18.9%) of salad samples. E.coli was detected at level 102-103 (n=12, 13.3%) and S. aureus was detected in 9 (10.0%) at levels of 103-104 cfu/g salad samples tested. In 4 (4.4%) of the salads samples S.aureus and E.coli were isolated together. Conclusion: The results indicate that the type of vegetable salads analysed may contain pathogenic bacteria and thereby represent a risk to the consumers in regard to foodborne diseases. Thus, it remains essential to include the significance of effective hygiene practices as an important safety measure in programmes of home hygiene, consumer education, and advice.},

In the past two decades, sprouted seeds have been a recurring food safety concern, with at least 55 documented foodborne outbreaks affecting more than 15,000 people. A compilation of selected publications was used to yield an analysis of the evolving safety and risk communication related to raw sprouts, including microbiological safety, efforts to improve production practices, and effectiveness of communication prior to, during, and after sprout-related outbreaks. Scientific investigation and media coverage of sprout-related outbreaks has led to improved production guidelines and public health enforcement actions, yet continued outbreaks call into question the effectiveness of risk management strategies and producer compliance. Raw sprouts remain a high-risk product and avoidance or thorough cooking are the only ways that consumers can reduce risk; even thorough cooking messages fail to acknowledge the risk of cross-contamination. Risk communication messages have been inconsistent over time with Canadian and U.S. governments finally aligning their messages in the past five years, telling consumers to avoid sprouts. Yet consumer and industry awareness of risk remains low. To minimize health risks linked to the consumption of sprout products, local and national public health agencies, restaurants, retailers and producers need validated, consistent and repeated risk messaging through a variety of sources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging coupled with multivariate image analysis techniques for detection of fecal contaminates on spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea) was evaluated. Violet fluorescence excitation was provided at 405 nm and light emission was recorded from 464 to 800 nm. Partial least square discriminant analysis and wavelength ratio methods were compared for detection accuracy for fecal contamination. Fluorescence emission profiles of spinach leaves were monitored over a 27 days storage period; peak emission blue-shifts were observed over the storage period accompanying a color change from green to green–yellow–brown hue. The PLSDA model developed correctly detected fecal contamination on 100 % of relatively fresh green spinach leaves used in this investigation, which also had soil contamination. The PLSDA model had 19 % false positives for non-fresh post storage leaves. A wavelength ratio technique using four wavebands (680, 688, 703 and 723 nm) was successful in identifying 100 % of fecal contaminates on both fresh and non-fresh leaves. An on-line fluorescence imaging inspection system for fecal contaminant detection has potential to allow fresh produce producers to reduce foodborne illnesses and prevent against the associated economic losses. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Ensuring the supply of safe, contaminant free fresh fruit and vegetables is of importance to consumers, suppliers and governments worldwide. In this study, three hyperspectral imaging (HSI) configurations coupled with two multivariate image analysis techniques are compared for detection of fecal contamination on spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). Fluorescence imaging in the visible region with ultra violet (UV) and violet excitation sources, and reflectance imaging in the visible to near-infrared regions were investigated. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and two band ratio analysis techniques were used to compare these HSI configurations. High detection accuracy was found for the two fluorescence HSI configurations compared to the visible/near infrared HSI. Both fluorescence HSI configurations had 100% detection rates for fecal contamination up to 1:10 dilution level and violet HSI had 99% and 87% detection rates for 1:20 and 1:30 levels, respectively. Results indicated that fluorescence imaging with the violet excitation performed superior to HSI with UV excitation for detection of a range of diluted fecal contamination on leafy greens. 5% or less false positives were observed for the fluorescence HSI configurations and were associated with yellow hue on the leaves. On-line detection of fecal contamination on leaves has the potential to reduce the cases of food borne illnesses and their associated costs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Leafy greens grown in the field can be susceptible to fecal matter contamination from uncontrolled livestock and wild animals entering the field. Pathogenic bacteria can be transferred via fecal matter and several outbreaks of E.coli O157:H7 have been associated with the consumption of leafy greens. This study examines the use of hyperspectral fluorescence imaging coupled with multivariate image analysis to detect fecal contamination on Spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). Hyperspectral fluorescence images from 464 to 800 nm were captured; ultraviolet excitation was supplied by two LED-based line light sources at 370 nm. Key wavelengths and algorithms useful for a contaminant screening optical imaging device were identified and developed, respectively.

   abstract = {Faecal contaminated fruits and vegetables have been linked to several outbreaks of foodbourne diseases. In-field detection of faecal matter would allow the producer to take action to reduce faecal contaminated produce entering the post-harvest processing line and the human food supply. No viable systems to accomplish this task have been developed to date. To address this, a prototype imaging system was developed to detect faecal matter on leafy greens. The system principally comprised of two monochrome cameras that were used to simultaneously capture images of the same target at two separate wavelengths, 690 and 710 nm, by utilising a beam-splitter and bandpass filters. The 710 nm and 690 nm waveband images were used for pixel-by-pixel calculation of a ratio image of the target, to which a thresholding technique was applied to classify pixels as either faecal matter or non-faecal matter. The system was tested on spinach leaves (Spinacia olerace) and three types of soils in an outdoor environment. On all samples evaluated, the imaging system, coupled with this waveband ratio normalisation method, successfully distinguished faecal matter from spinach leaves and soil under varying atmospheric conditions. These findings are very encouraging and further study is needed to determine if such a technique would reliably detect faecal material in an agricultural field environment where leaf orientation and contamination concentration levels are highly variable. © 2018},

   abstract = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the causative agent of human rat lungworm disease, is the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis worldwide and is endemic throughout Asia Pacific. It is acquired through the consumption of infected freshwater mollusks or contaminated produce. Human angiostrongyliasis is usually a self-limited disease presenting with headache and various neurologic sequelae varying from cranial nerve palsies to radiculitis and/or paresthesias. Fatal cases are rare, and manifest as fulminant meningomyeloencephalitis. The diagnosis is made through the use of clinical history, exam, and laboratory data including peripheral blood counts, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations, and serologic or molecular diagnostic techniques. Medical therapy is largely focused on symptomatic relief, and includes analgesics, lumbar puncture, and corticosteroids. In resource-limited settings, prevention is key, and the use of analgesics can provide symptomatic relief after infection. Efforts to increase disease awareness have been made in endemic areas, as evidenced by the recent Rat Lungworm Disease Scientific Workshop which was held in Honolulu in 2011. The proceedings of the workshop were published in a supplement to this journal (Hawaii J Med Public Health. Jun 2013;72(6):Supp 2). However, wilderness medicine and travel medicine specialists must also be aware of the disease, how it is contracted, its presentation, and treatment options should they encounter a patient who is in or has returned from an endemic area. This brief review highlights eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis, including an example case, an overview of its clinical presentation, treatment options, and prevention.},

   abstract = {Fresh-cut Iceberg lettuce packaged in modified atmosphere packages and spinach in perforated film bags were irradiated with gamma rays at doses of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4kGy. After irradiation, the samples were stored for 14 days at 4°C. O 2 levels in the packages of fresh-cut Iceberg lettuce decreased and CO 2 levels increased with increasing radiation dose, suggesting that irradiation increased respiration rates of lettuce. Tissue browning of irradiated cut lettuce was less severe than that of non-irradiated, probably due to the lower O 2 levels in the packages. However, samples irradiated at 3 and 4kGy had lower maximum force and more severe sogginess than the non-irradiated control. In addition, ascorbic acid content of irradiated lettuce was 22-40% lower than the non-irradiated samples after 14 days of storage. The visual appearance of spinach was not affected by irradiation even at a dose of 4kGy. Consumer acceptance suggested that more people would dislike and would not buy spinach that was treated at 3 and 4kGy as compared to the non-irradiated sample. Overall, irradiation at doses of 1 and 2kGy may be employed to enhance microbial safety of fresh-cut Iceberg lettuce and spinach while maintaining quality. © 2011.},

   abstract = {Methamidophos (MDP) and dichlorvos (DDVP) are organophosphorous pesticides which are commonly used for pest control in agriculture to obtain better yields. The occurrence of OPP residues in vegetables is known to cause serious health problems to consumers. In the present research, a laboratory-scale experiment was performed to investigate the effects of ultrasound (US)/ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) combination on the degradation of the two pesticides on lettuce. Various parameters including ozone flow rate, water temperature, treatment time and initial concentration of OPPs were chosen to identify their effects on the degradation rate of MDP under US/O<inf>3</inf> treatment. The degradation rate could reach up to 82.16% under the optimal conditions of ozone flow rate 75 mg min-1, time 60 min, initial concentration 0.1-0.2 mg kg-1, and water temperature 8 °C. It was observed that the treatments with O<inf>3</inf>, US and US/O<inf>3</inf> had no obvious impact on the quality of the lettuce. Subsequently, the reaction kinetics of DDVP degradation in water were studied, and the dynamical equation of US/O<inf>3</inf> treatment was obtained as: C = C<inf>0</inf> exp [-0:0041 exp (-28:9568/RT) C<inf>0</inf> -0:5876Q<inf>O2</inf> -0:7982t], which confirmed the practicability and applicability of the US/O<inf>3</inf> degradation process. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Pomegranate (PG) molasses is an essential condiment that is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine in local and international gastronomic markets. There is scarce information on the inhibitory effect of PG molasses on Salmonella growth mainly under in situ conditions and in a food matrix. PG molasses in different dilution ratios of 1:1 and 1:7, combined with sodium chloride (2%, v/v), vinegar (2.4%, v/v), and in a dressing mix was tested against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 on parsley and salad vegetables. The results showed significant log reductions in Salmonella on parsley treated with PG solutions for 15, 30, and 60 min, reaching a level of 2.55 log cfu/g. The addition of sodium chloride (2%, v/v) and vinegar (2.4%, v/v) to PG molasses did not exert a synergistic or antagonistic effect on its antibacterial activity. Additionally, the application of PG molasses dressing on salads contaminated with low (3 log cfu/g) and high (6 log cfu/g) inoculum levels resulted in 2–3 log reduction independent of temperature (p <.05) compared with 0.5–1 log reduction for thorough washing alone which may damage the leaf surfaces. This study showed that PG molasses has a great efficacy against S. typhimurium and the potential to enhance the microbial safety of ready-to-eat salads and parsley leaves. Practical applications: The implication of fresh-cut vegetables in food poisoning are well documented, at the same time, the washing methods in restaurants or home settings are reportedly not effective enough to mitigate the risks of pathogens found in vegetables. This study shows that Pomegranate (PG) molasses has a greater efficacy than chlorine (200 ppm) against S. typhimurium and achieved comparable to greater log reduction values than organic acids. The storage temperature and food matrix did not alter the potency of PG. The present work showed that promoting the use of PG as a natural additive and condiment to ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables offers a great potential to effectively reduce the risk of Salmonella contamination and to improve their microbial safety. Furthermore, this study provided preliminary data that serve as additional inputs in quantitative microbial risk assessment models for estimating the risk of Salmonella infection associated with consuming RTE salads served in Mediterranean cuisines. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Eco-toxicological risk and impact of pesticides was estimated on three important parasitoids of butterflies viz., Hyposoter ebeninus, Cotesia glomerata and Pteromalus puparum. Four commonly used pesticides were evaluated using standard protocol (of IOBC/WPRS-group). In laboratory tests, the survival of the female wasps decreased significantly on fresh contact and ingestion of deltamethrin, spinosad and azadirachtin; whereas Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk) was found harmless pesticide. Under semi-field conditions, parasitoid mortality decreased significantly on fresh contact with the pesticides. Although, at 72 h after treatment, spinosad and deltamethrin were found harmful (Class-IV) and azadirachtin was moderately harmful (Class-III), whereas Btk was harmless (Class-I). Furthermore, 15-day-old residues of pesticides (except deltamethrin) were harmless to all parasitoid species under semi-field conditions. Notably, adult emergence and pupal duration in pesticide-treated cocoons were not significantly affected; however, their survival decreased after emergence except in Btk. The contact and oral toxicity trends of the pesticides were almost similar for three species of parasitoid females and pupae; however little variability was observed in toxicity to the host caterpillars parasitized by H. ebeninus (HCPHE) and C. glomerata (HCPCG). In semi-field tests, fresh residues of all the pesticides were harmful to HCPHE and HCPCG. However, action of Btk was slightly delayed and toxicity was rather low for HCPCG. In 15-day-old residues, deltamethrin and azadirachtin were slightly harmful to the parasitized caterpillars, whereas those of Btk and spinosad were harmless. Since, Btk appeared to be safe for parasitoids; it could be used for managing cabbage butterflies in brassicaceous crops. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {In Brazil the intestinal parasitism is one of the problems normally diagnosed in public health. These diseases are widely spread out in virtue of the precariousness of the sanitary conditions; the vegetables serve as one of the main vehicles of its transmission. The contamination of vegetables can occur in the field, in the period of production, during the process of harvest or even in the exit of the product towards the table of the consumer, because the microorganisms can be multiplied in foods according to the humidity and temperature. The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality of lettuces proceeding from free fairs of Uberlândia city, MG - Brazil - in relation to the microbiological and parasitological contamination. From June to September/2009, 96 samples of lettuces had been collected randomly in 12 stalls of different producers. Such samples had been submitted to the method of spontaneous sedimentation for 24 hours for parasitological analysis. The found results indicated 100% of parasitic contamination in the evaluated samples; being distinguished Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium spp. Considering the raised frequency of parasitic contamination and the potential risk of illnesses propagated by the vegetables, a more operating sanitary monitoring in the fiscalization of foods offered to the population is suggested, as well as a program of sanitary education for the producers and consumers.},

   abstract = {A facile synthesis of hollow core/shell-structured CuO@SiO2 microspheres with uniform size and well-defined morphology is demonstrated. Electrochemical measurement results prove that the as synthesized CuO@SiO2 microspheres exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity toward the determination of 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA). Based on this, a simple and rapid electrochemical sensing strategy has been successfully constructed for the detection of 6-BA, which exhibits high sensitivity and good reproducibility. The peak current of 6-BA increases linearly with its concentration in the range of 50 nM similar to 100 mu M, and the detection limit is 2.6 nM. In addition, the practical analytical application of the sensing platform is assessed by determination of 6-BA in real sport vegetables with satisfactory results. Armed with the remarkable advantages, such as ease of use, low analyte consumption, inexpensive cost, and fast response time, the electrochemical sensing strategy may hold great potential for the in-field food safety monitoring.},

   abstract = {Chinese cabbage is rich in glucosinolates (GLS) and their breakdown products, mainly isothiocyanates (ITC), which are assumed to be human health-promoting compounds. Sulphur and nitrogen have been shown to influence concentrations and patterns of both. Little is known as to whether the effect of varying sulphur and nitrogen nutrition on glucosinolate and isothiocyanate content is influenced by the genotype. Therefore, two cultivars of Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis were grown with increasing S (0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 g pot-1) and N (1 and 2 g pot-1) supply. Results show that total GLS concentration increased with higher N and S application, but ratios between individual GLS compounds remained unchanged. High N supply reduced the concentration of GLS, especially of the aliphatic ones, while the indole and aromatic GLS exhibited statistically insignificant responses to increasing N and S application. The profile of breakdown products was dominated by epithionitriles, followed by ITCs and nitriles. The ITCs were substantially reduced in response to increasing N and decreasing S supply. This was not observed for nitriles. Overall, GLS pattern were primarily influenced by the genetic background of the cultivar and less influenced by differential nutrition. Results show that selection of the cultivar is of utmost importance when glucosinolates and their breakdown products shall be increased by fertilization. © The Author(s) 2016.},

It also includes the technological and managerial interventions related to primary production, postharvest handling, processing practices, distribution, and consumer handling to eliminate pathogens in leafy greens. When the microbiological risk is already present, preventive measures to limit actual contamination events or pathogen survival are considered intervention strategies. In codes of practice the focus is mainly put on explaining preventive measures. However, it is also important to establish more focused intervention strategies. This review is centered mainly on leafy vegetables as the commodity identified as the highest priority in terms of fresh produce microbial safety from a global perspective. There is no unique preventive measure or intervention strategy that could be applied at one point of the food chain. We should encourage growers of leafy greens to establish procedures based on the HACCP principles at the level of primary production. The traceability of leafy vegetables along the chain is an essential element in ensuring food safety. Thus, in dealing with the food safety issues associated with fresh produce it is clear that a multidisciplinary farm to fork strategy is required. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Discarding of contaminated products before marketing would guarantee food safety and could be an economic advantage. The purpose of this study was to develop a fast quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based method for aerobic bacterial detection and enumeration in fresh-cut lettuce. After minimal processing, lettuce pieces were inoculated with a streptomycin resistant E. coli strain that allowed selective quantification on streptomycin supplemented LB plates. Bacterial DNA was easily extracted from centrifugation water and used in qPCR. Bacterial load in the centrifugation water which comes up during processing was sampled as reference. These results were related to initial lettuce contamination, both in plate assays and qPCR, which again affects recontamination during chilling storage of lettuce pieces. The proposed innovative protocol, which includes sample taking, DNA extraction and qPCR from centrifugation water, can be performed within less than five hours, allowing direct intervention measures before fresh cut commodity is shipped from the factory.},

   abstract = {Arcobacters are considered potential emerging food and waterborne pathogens. However, there is no data on the presence of Arcobacter spp. in fresh vegetables. Therefore the objective of this research was to study the presence of Arcobacter spp. in fresh lettuces.Fifty fresh lettuces purchased from different local shops in Valencia (Spain) were analyzed. The assay was performed simultaneously by cultural and molecular methods. Isolates were identified by real-time, multiplex PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA fragment (PCR-RFLP). Finally, all the isolates were genotyped using the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) method.Arcobacter sp. was detected in 10 of the 50 samples (20%) by real-time PCR, being A. butzleri the unique detected species by mPCR. The detection levels obtained by conventional PCR (7 samples/50, 14%) were slightly lower. These seven samples were found to be positive also by culture isolation. All 19 obtained isolates were identified as A. butzleri by multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP. Great genetic heterogeneity among the isolates was observed by RAPD-PCR profiling.To our knowledge, this is the first study in which Arcobacter spp. is detected in fresh vegetables such as lettuces. Although these foods are generally considered safe, given the large quantities consumed and the fact that further cooking is absent, lettuce could be a source of Arcobacters of public health concern. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {In this study, the antimicrobial activity of oregano oil was investigated under different attachment conditions of Salmonella spp. to iceberg lettuce. Inoculated lettuce was either not dried or dried for 30 min, 60 min, or 120 min, under either static air or moving air. Washing iceberg lettuce with 500 ppm oregano oil for 1, 5, and 10 min reduced the population of Salmonella spp. by (respectively) 1.3, 1.65, and 2.28 log cfu/g following the most challenging inoculation conditions, an inoculum drying period of 2 h under moving air. Across all inoculation conditions, increasing the treatment time significantly increased the reductions in the populations of Salmonella spp. (P &lt; 0.05). Browning and softening of the lettuce leaf surface was observed after 10 min of treatment with oregano oil. For each treatment time, attachment times and drying under static compared with moving air did not significantly affect the antimicrobial efficacy of the various oregano oil treatments (P &gt; 0.05). The results obtained in this study suggest that oregano oil can effectively reduce populations of Salmonella attached to lettuce leaf surfaces. © 2012 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

A recent study revealed huge microbial contamination within bottle gourd, pumpkin, radish and eggplant together with the microbial load of the plantation soils, fertilizers and irrigation waters. Present study further endeavored to identify such contamination level among potato, cauliflower, cabbage and squash samples and depicted on the contamination sources. Microbial load within the vegetable samples (around 106 cfu/g) was estimated near or lower than those within surroundings (around 108 cfu/g). Thus the data reveals that the microbiological attributes within the vegetable samples largely depended on the microorganisms inhabiting soils, fertilizers and on the type and quantity of the aquatic microorganisms within the water bodies surrounding the sampling sites. © All Rights Reserved.},

   abstract = {A better and regular control of the production chain of fresh fruits and vegetables is necessary, because a contamination of the product by human- and phyto-pathogenic microorganisms may result in high losses during storage and poses a threat to human health. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the occurrence and the diversity of microorganisms within single processing steps is required to allow target-oriented produce safety control. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was successfully used to identify bacterial colonies. Bacteria can be identified with high accuracy by comparing them with generated spectra of a reference database.In this study, spinach and wash water samples were taken of the complete process line of a spinach-washing plant. Bacteria in the samples were grown on plate-count, Arcobacter selective, marine and blood agar. In total, 451 colonies were evaluated by MALDI-TOF MS, 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis.50% of the detected species belonged to the class of Gammaproteobacteria. Firmicutes were present with 22%. Mostly, the detected species showed 16S rRNA gene sequence dissimilarities larger than 1% to known reference species and, hence, could not be assigned to a distinct species. However, many isolated species belonged to genera which contain pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the bacterial diversity on the spinach surface increased after the first washing step indicating a process-borne contamination of the spinach. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The rapid and nondestructive determination of active compositions in Chrysanthemum morifolium (Hangbaiju) is of great value for producers and consumers. Hyperspectral imaging as a rapid and nondestructive technique was used to determine total polysaccharides and total flavonoids content in Chrysanthemum morifolium. Hyperspectral images of different sizes of Chrysanthemum morifolium flowers were acquired. Pixel-wise spectra within all samples were preprocessed by wavelet transform (WT) followed by standard normal variate (SNV). Partial least squares (PLS) and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) were used to build prediction models using sample average spectra calculated by preprocessed pixel-wise spectra. The LS-SVM model performed better than the PLS models, with the determination of the coefficient of calibration (R2c) and prediction (R2p) being over 0.90 and the residual predictive deviation (RPD) being over 3 for total polysaccharides and total flavonoids content prediction. Prediction maps of total polysaccharides and total flavonoids content in Chrysanthemum morifolium flowers were successfully obtained by LS-SVM models, which exhibited the best performances. The overall results showed that hyperspectral imaging was a promising technique for the rapid and accurate determination of active ingredients in Chrysanthemum morifolium, indicating the great potential to develop an online system for the quality determination of Chrysanthemum morifolium. © 2018 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Community-acquired carriage and infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are increasing worldwide, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. The origins of community-acquired ESBL-E carriage and infections remain unclear. Bean sprouts are a potential source of Enterobacteriaceae for the community, as illustrated by outbreaks of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in the past. The current study focuses on contamination of retail bean sprouts with ESBL-E in the Netherlands. Of 131 bean sprout samples purchased between 2013 and 2016, 25 (19%) were contaminated with ESBL-E. The detected isolates were almost exclusively Klebsiella spp. and co-resistance to other antibiotics was observed frequently. Over time there was substantial genetic diversity between isolates. On the other hand, isolates from samples closely matched in time were frequently clonally related, indicative of batch contamination. Remarkably, no Escherichia coli was found. In conclusion, bean sprouts frequently harbor ESBL-E, which is a potential source for consumers. © 2018 Huizinga et al.

Alef. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to determine whether kale, cv. Ripbor, responded to different natural sources of growing medium amendments: 47.5 g K humate/pot; 50 g dry vermicastst/pot; or 100 g volcanic minerals/pot. Each of the amendments were individually added to 1 kg Pro-mix BX/pot with the Pro-mix BX alone as the control. Plant growth rate grown in dry vermicasts was highest. The fresh weight was higher due to volcanic minerals than for the control and values for K humate and dry vermicasts were similar to the control and volcanic minerals. The dry vermicasts reduced leaf and stem mass densities compared to other treatments. Leaf dry matter content was increased by approximately 29% in the K humate, the volcanic minerals, and the control compared to the dry vermicasts. SPAD values were higher in K humate and volcanic minerals than in other treatments. Amendment did not affect leaf fresh weight yield but was lower in the control. Percentages of N and protein were highest but the C:N ratio was lowest in plants grown in dry vermicasts. Overall, application of single-dose dry vermicasts resulted in the highest productivity compared to the other treatments. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In addition, the effects of organic acids on the microbial load of broccoli samples during storage at +4°C were determined for 7 days. The organic acids tested were acetic, benzoic, sorbic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, lactic and succinic acids and the concentrations used were 1 and 2% (w/v and v/v). L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium were grown on the selective media before the contamination. The broccoli samples were dipped first into the pathogen solutions containing L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium, then into the organic acids and subsequently counted on Oxford agar and bismuth sulphite agar, respectively. The broccoli samples dipped into the organic acids without pathogen culture were also investigated in terms of total mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, psychrotrophic microorganisms, Pseudomonas spp., total lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae spp. and total yeast-moulds for 7 days stored at 4°C. S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes log reductions were determined at between 3 to 3.28 and 2.63 to 2.84 log colony-forming units/g with 1 and 2% of malic acid and between 3.68 to 4.17 and 2.68 to 2.9 log with 1 and 2% of tartaric acid, respectively. The malic, tartaric, lactic, succinic acids and acetic acid in the tested concentrations could be used to inhibit S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes and prolong the shelf-life of fresh-cut broccoli. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Over the last two decades, the demand for organic products has grown rapidly in the world due to increased concern about side effects of pesticides on the environment and human health. Studies were conducted in organic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) from 2004 to 2005 at the Black Sea Agricultural Research Institute in Samsun, Turkey, to determine the suppressive effects of summer cover crops on weeds. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments consisted of grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sudangrass [Sorghum vulgare Pers. var. sudanense (Piper) Hitchc.], hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), grain amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and bare ground with no cover crop. Weed density and total weed dry biomass were assessed before and at 14, 28, and 56 days after incorporation (DAI) of the cover crops. The cover crops produced between 1.2 and 3 t ha-1 biomass and grain sorghum produced more dry matter than any other species in both years. After incorporation of the cover crops, hairy vetch and sorghum treatments showed fewer weed species, and lower weed density than the other cover crops in both years. Hairy vetch, grain sorghum, and sudangrass were the most effective cover crops and reduced total weed dry biomass by 90.3%, 87.4%, and 86.9% in 2004, and by 88%, 86.3%, and 85.2% in 2005, respectively. Cover crop residue suppressed many broadleaved weed species but failed to control grass weeds. Hairy vetch treatments produced the highest yield, followed by sudangrass and grain sorghum. Yields with grain amaranth and pea were similar to that of the control. These results indicate that hairy vetch, grain sorghum, and sudangrass can be used to suppress weeds in early season of organic lettuce production. © 2009 Springer Science &amp; Business Media BV.},

   abstract = {One of the main ways in transmitting parasites to humans is through consuming contaminated raw vegetables. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of parasitological contamination (helminthes eggs, Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica cysts) of salad vegetables sold at supermarkets and street vendors in Amman and Baqa'a - Jordan. A total of 133 samples of salad vegetables were collected and examined for the prevalence of parasites. It was found that 29% of the samples were contaminated with different parasites. Of the 30 lettuce, 33 tomato, 42 parsley and 28 cucumber samples examined the prevalence of Ascaris spp. eggs was 43%, 15%, 21% and 4%; Toxocara spp. eggs was 30%, 0%, 0% and 4%; Giardia spp. cysts was 23%, 6%, 0% and 0%; Taenia/Echinococcus eggs was 20%, 0%, 5% and 0%; Fasciola hepatica eggs was 13%, 3%, 2% and 0%; and E. histolytica cysts was 10%, 6%, 0% and 0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of parasite in salad vegetables either between supermarkets and street vendors, or between Amman and Baqa'a, Ascaris spp. was found to be the highest prevalent parasite in salad vegetables from supermarkets and street vendors and from Amman and Baqa'a. Our results pointed out that, the parasitic contamination of salad vegetables found in our study might be caused by irrigating crops with faecal contaminated water. We concluded that salad vegetables sold in Amman and Baqa'a may cause a health risk to consumers. School of Allied Medical Sciences, Zarqa University College P.O.

   abstract = {Background: The present study was the first attempt for determination and measurement of pesticide residues in tomatoes used in salad production plants in Isfahan, central Iran. Methods: A multiresidue method based on modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) sample preparation, followed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed and validated for the determination of 15 pesticides (permethrin, primicarb, dichlorvos, diazinone, fenpropathrin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, malathion, chlortalonil, brompropilate, propargit, tetradifone, phosalone, iprodion and endosulfane) from different classes. The recovery yields ranged from 83.84 to 119.73%and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was below 20.54%. The limits of detection (LODs) were between 1.63to 10.5 mg/kg and the limits of quantifications (LOQs) were between 5.43to35 mg/kg. The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of 22 tomato samples obtained from salad production plants in Isfahan in Sep to Dec 2014. Results: An amount of 31.81% of samples showed contamination above maximum residue levels (MRLs) with pesticides. In addition, 13.6% of samples had contamination with diazinone and 18.18% of samples with chlorpyrifos. Conclusion: A full consideration is essential for tomatoes used in salad and food productions. It suggests a need for revision of the current trend of supervision for tomatoes and other vegetables presented in wholesale markets. In all, the study confirms that pesticide residue determination in food products, especially in raw fruits and vegetables, is a very demanding task in public health safety and trade. © 2016.

   abstract = {Access to large sources of quality water for irrigation is fundamental to the hygienic cultivation of fresh produce. However, due to factors such as contamination of water bodies, access to clean uncontaminated water is fast becoming an ever increasing global challenge. The unavailability of quality source water increases the risk of contamination of fresh produce with human pathogenic microorganisms, which may compromise public health. Over the past few years, there has been a decline in the microbiological quality of surface water and other sources used for irrigation. This is mainly due to upstream fecal contamination. Therefore, the assessment and subsequent suitability of alternative water sources for irrigation such as roof-harvested rainwater should be considered. Contrasting views regarding the quality of roof-harvested rainwater (RHRW) have been published. Pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter species and Listeria monocytogenes have been reported in RHRW. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, and lettuce are produced across a wide range of farming systems from regulated formal (commercial farms) to informal (small-scale and homestead gardens) setups. This review will discuss global water challenges associated with irrigation water, microbial quality of source water for irrigation, crop contamination, and pathogen detection and characterization methodologies. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

Seven non-inoculated heads and one inoculated head (≈5 log CFU/g) of lettuce were placed into commercial sink filled with 76 L of tap water (TW), electrolyzed water (EW, free chlorine: 43 ± 6 ppm), lactic acid and phosphoric acid-based sanitizer (LPA, pH 2.89), or citric acid-based sanitizer (CA, pH 2.78) and soaked for 5 min. Two subsequent batches (eight non-inoculated heads per batch) were soaked in the same solution. Soaking with EW significantly reduced the population of S. enterica (2.8 ± 1.5 log CFU/g), E. coli O157:H7 (3.4 ± 1.1 log CFU/g), and L. monocytogenes (2.6 ± 0.7 log CFU/g) inoculated on Romaine lettuce compared to TW, LPA, and CA (p < 0.05). On Red leaf lettuce, EW significantly reduced populations of S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7, but not L. monocytogenes compared to other treatments. No significant difference was noted between TW, LPA, and CA in reducing foodborne pathogens (p > 0.05) or preventing cross-contamination. Soaking with EW prevented cross-contamination among lettuce heads and controlled bacterial populations in crisping water for three consecutive batches. EW may be an effective option as a sanitizer to minimizing the cross-contamination of leafy greens during the retail crisping. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Contamination with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella have called into question the safety and microbial quality of bagged ready-to-eat leafy greens. This study expands on previous findings that these goods have high total bacteria counts (TBC) and coliform counts, variation in counts among different lots, that Escherichia coli is present, and disparities in counts when bags are top or bottom sampled. Nearly 100 bags of baby spinach and hearts of romaine lettuce from a single brand were subjected to both top and bottom sampling. Product was blended, and a portion serially diluted and plated to obtain TBC. Total coliform and E. coli levels were estimated by the most-probable-number (MPN) technique with ColiComplete discs. Top-sampled TBC from bags of baby spinach (48 bags, 13 different lots) ranged from 3.9 to 8.1 log CFU/g and bottom-sampled TBC ranged from 4.0 to 8.2 log CFU/g, with 52% of the bags (or 39% of the lots) producing TBC higher in bottom samples. For hearts of romaine (47 bags from 19 different lots), top-sampled bags had TBC ranging from 2.4 to 7.0 log, and bottom-sampled bags had TBC from 3.3 to 7.3 log, with 64% of the bags (or 63% of the lots) showing higher TBC in bottom samples. However, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the top and bottom samples from either commodity contain the same TBC (P ≥ 0.08). No E. coli was detected and total coliform bacteria counts were, with few exceptions, ≥ 210 MPN/g, irrespective of TBC. In general, lots with the most number of days before the printed "use-by" date had lower TBC. However, the R 2values for either baby spinach (0.4085) or hearts of romaine (0.2946) suggest that age might not be a very good predictor of higher TBC. TBC varied widely between lots and even more so within same-lot samples, as indicated by the sum of squares results. This finding, along with higher TBC in bottom samples, suggests further consideration when a microbiological sampling scheme of bagged produce is designed.

   abstract = {Fresh produce companies operate their food safety management systems (FSMS) in a complex context. On the one hand, during setting and operating their FSMS activities, companies need to consider the riskiness of the 'FSMS context' of the company, including the risk of product and production, and the limitations and opportunities of the organisational and chain characteristics. On the other hand, companies with their narrow 'FSMS context' and actual FSMS, can be influenced by the 'broad context' in a country and sector. This paper presents an analytical framework with operational tools that enable assessment of the status of FSMS in view of the context riskiness at company level, and exploration of the influence of the 'broad context' in a country and sector. The latter was defined to include: food safety governance, agro-climatic, market, and public policy environment. Empirical data from three case studies of leafy greens production, intentionally chosen to represent three European regions with their specific contexts, was used to validate the analytical framework. As a conclusion, we postulate that the FSMS output is a function of the broad context in a country and sector, the 'FSMS context' in a company, and implemented food safety management system. The model is a first step towards conceptualisation of the complex systems influencing FSMS implementation and operation in companies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Brassica crop species are prolific producers of indole-sulfur phytoalexins that are thought to have an important role in plant disease resistance. These molecules are conspicuously absent in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and little is known about the enzymatic steps that assemble the key precursor brassinin. Here, we report the minimum set of biosynthetic genes required to generate cruciferous phytoalexins starting from the well-studied glucosinolate pathway. In vitro biochemical characterization revealed an additional role for the previously described carbon-sulfur lyase SUR1 in processing cysteine-isothiocyanate conjugates, as well as the S-methyltransferase DTCMT that methylates the resulting dithiocarbamate, together completing a pathway to brassinin. Additionally, the β-glucosidase BABG that is present in Brassica rapa but absent in Arabidopsis was shown to act as a myrosinase and may be a determinant of plants that synthesize phytoalexins from indole glucosinolate. Transient expression of the entire pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana yields brassinin, demonstrating that the biosynthesis of indole-sulfur phytoalexins can be engineered into noncruciferous plants. The identification of these biosynthetic enzymes and the heterologous reconstitution of the indole-sulfur phytoalexin pathway sheds light on an important pathway in an edible plant and opens the door to using metabolic engineering to systematically quantify the impact of cruciferous phytoalexins on plant disease resistance and human health. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

   abstract = {The objective of this study was the determination of the efficiency of pulsed light (PL) treatments for the decontamination of endive salad and mung bean sprouts, as well as the assessment of quality changes in relation to discoloration and alteration of respiration activity. Produce samples were artificially inoculated with two bacterial test strains Escherichia coli (DSM 498) and Listeria innocua (DSM 20649) and exposed to PL at different energy doses. The inactivation efficiency with regard to the naturally occurring microbiota was also investigated. Besides microbiological investigations, color changes were determined as well as the produce respiration during chilled storage. The results indicated that inactivation of more than 2 log was possible with one flash in the case of fresh-cut salad, while the reduction on mung bean sprouts was limited to approximately 1.6 log with one flash, irrespective if the natural flora or inoculated E. coli or L. innocua were considered. The UV part of the PL proved to be exclusively responsible for the inactivation of microorganisms. Significant lower levels of microbial counts of treated compared with untreated samples were maintained for up to 6 days. In the case of endive salad, a dose-dependent progressive discoloration and increase in respiration was diminished by applying optical bandpass filters, which only slightly affected the inactivation efficiency. In contrast, PL treatments showed a positive effect on color and general appearance of mung bean sprouts, while the respiration was almost unaffected. However, care must be taken with regard to efficiency-limiting matrix effects and impact on food quality. These aspects have to be assessed for each treated product. The integration of PL in industrial food processing plants could be an alternative way to improve the microbial quality of fresh produce, and therefore have a positive impact on public health by reducing the risk of contaminations with pathogenic bacteria.},

   abstract = {Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are directly emitted into air from human activities, contributing to the pollutant load of plants and posing risks to food safety. Foliar surface characteristics affect particle interception and retention from air; however the influence of foliar surface free energy (SFE), a quantitative measure of polar and dispersive surface forces which determine hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, has not been investigated. Here, soil-grown plantlet leaves of arugula (low SFE) and escarole (high SFE) were exposed to Pt NPs (5-500 mg Pt NPs per L) for 5 days. Pt NP internalization and translocation, aggregation/agglomeration on leaf surfaces, and SFE changes were analyzed. Plantlets were also root-exposed to Pt NPs (one exposure to 20 mL of 50 mg L-1 dispersion) to provide a comparison between leaf-to-root and root-to-leaf translocation. Among foliar-exposed plants, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry data showed that relative to escarole, arugula contained higher Pt concentrations in leaves (33, 31, and 14 times higher for 5, 50, and 500 mg L-1 exposures, respectively) and lower Pt concentrations in roots (6, 4, and 3 times lower for 5, 50, and 500 mg L-1 exposures, respectively). For both plants, the proportion of Pt translocated from roots to leaves (99% and 28% for arugula and escarole, respectively) was higher than that from leaves to roots (&lt;1% for both plants). Scanning electron micrographs of foliar-exposed leaves (500 mg Pt NPs per L) showed a much higher degree of Pt NP aggregation/agglomeration on arugula relative to escarole, in addition to stomata closure from likely shading effects on arugula. Analysis of foliar SFE results based on acid-base theory did not indicate any relationship between Pt NP exposure and changes to SFE. We conclude that plants with low SFE are significantly more likely to adhere and retain NPs than plants with high SFE, providing implications for the application of nanopesticides, where NP adsorption and retention are of interest, and for food safety, where the presence of NPs should be minimized. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Consumption of raw vegetables salad represented an important mean of transmission of various infectious diseases, which is accountable for global public health problem. It plays a significant role in human morbidity, mortality and economic loss. The aim of the present study was to determine microbial and parasitic contamination of ready-to-eat vegetables salad served in restaurants of Hail city, KSA. A total of 25 different ready-to-eat vegetables salads were collected aseptically from different restaurants of Hail city, Saudi Arabia; and were analyzed for total heterotrophs and coliforms along with parasites. The highest number of viable count was found in sample number R-2 (4.91 log CFU/g) and least microbial loads (2.25 log CFU/g) were observed in sample number R-9. A significant microbial load was recorded in the samples even after third washing. Intestinal parasites were also detected in 16% of unwashed samples and not in standard washed samples. There was significant difference between ready-to-eat vegetable salad and salad after three successive washing. This study revealed the potential hazard of ready-to-eat salads. These findings may have important implications for global food safety and emphasize the importance of raw vegetables salad in threatening public health by transmission of microbes and parasites to humans in Hail, KSA. These results indicate the need of implementing quality programs in the production chain of ready-to-eat vegetable salad to improve microbiological safety.},

Association between T. gondii infection and the consumption of unwashed raw fruits and vegetables contaminated with oocysts has been reported and the increasing habit to eat pre-washed ready-to-eat salads poses a new potential risk for consumers. It is therefore important to trace the occurrence of potential contamination with this parasite to guarantee the safety of ready-to-eat vegetables. Detection of T. gondii in vegetables by molecular techniques has been achieved but low sensitivity (PCR) or expensive equipments (qPCR) limit routine applicability. Here, we describe the development and validation of a sensitive and robust method relying on a LAMP assay, targeting the 529 bp locus, to detect T. gondii oocysts down to 25 oocysts/50 g in ready-to-eat baby lettuce. The LAMP has been also adapted for a faster visualization of the result by a lateral flow dipstick chromatographic detection method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Glucosinolates are natural products containing nitrogen and sulfur, mainly found in plants from the order Caparales, and their antimicrobial activity has been shown elsewhere. For this work we collected mango fruits with anthracnose symptoms, and from them the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was isolated and identified. Pathogen spores were placed on PDA containing different concentrations of glucoraphane (1.54, 0.92, 0.46, 0.15, 0.02 y 0 μg μL-1) previously isolated from broccoli (Brassica oleracea cv. 'Itálica') florets. We evaluated spore germination until control treatment showed its highest percentage of germination. After 10 h of evaluation the concentrations of 1.54 and 0.92 μg μL-1, caused complete inhibition of spore germination. The median lethal concentration was 0.65 μg μL-1. Based on these results glucoraphane represents a friendly alternative for consumers, because of its capability to control anthracnose in harvested mango fruits.},

Correlation analysis was used to select the most significant waveband pairs for two-band ratio and difference methods in distinguishing contaminated and uncontaminated leaf areas. For this investigation, two-band ratios using bands at 665.6 nm and 680.0 nm (F665.6/F680.0) for lettuce and at 660.8 nm and 680.0 nm (F660.8/F680.0) for spinach effectively differentiated all contamination spots applied to the lettuce and spinach leaves, respectively. The fluorescence emission peaks for the faecal matter of animals that consume green plant materials and for chlorophyll a occur in close proximity in the red spectral region. Consequently, a high spectral resolution would be required for multispectral imaging with these two-band ratios for online implementation to detect bovine faecal contamination on leafy greens such as Romaine lettuce and baby spinach. © 2014.},

It may be possible to increase the efficacy of such surveys using imaging techniques that rely on detection of fluorescence responses of fecal material to UV excitation. However, fluorescence responses are easily masked by ambient illumination. This study investigated the potential of using a shroud to reduce the impact of ambient illumination on responses measured using relatively inexpensive optical components. During periods of near peak insolation, even with full shrouding, results indicate that reliable detection would be problematic. Towards dusk, effective imaging could be accomplished even with a gap of 250 cm at the bottom of the shroud. Results suggest that imaging using relatively inexpensive components could provide the basis for detection of fecal contamination in produce fields if surveys were conducted during dawn or dusk, or at night. © 2017 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms underlying Cd trophic transfer along the soil-lettuce-snail food chain were investigated. The fate of Cd within cells, revealed by assessment of Cd chemical forms and of subcellular partitioning, differed between the two examined lettuce species that we examined (L. longifolia and L. crispa). The species-specific internal Cd fate not only influenced Cd burdens in lettuce, with higher Cd levels in L. crispa, but also affected Cd transfer efficiency to the consumer snail (Achatina fulica). Especially, the incorporation of Cd chemical forms (Cd in the inorganic, water-soluble and pectates and protein-integrated forms) in lettuce could best explain Cd trophic transfer, when compared to dietary Cd levels alone and/or subcellular Cd partitioning. Trophically available metal on the subcellular partitioning base failed to shed light on Cd transfer in this study. After 28-d of exposure, most Cd was trapped in the viscera of Achatina fulica, and cadmium bio-magnification was noted in the snails, as the transfer factor of lettuce-to-snail soft tissue was larger than one. This study provides a first step to apply a chemical speciation approach to dictate the trophic bioavailability of Cd through the soil-plant-snail system, which might be an important pre-requisite for mechanistic understanding of metal trophic transfer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Contamination of lettuce bySalmonellahas caused serious public health problems. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in food, but it is inaccurate as it might amplify DNA from dead target cells as well. This study aimed to investigate the stability of DNA of deadSalmonellacells in lettuce and to develop an approach to detecting viableSalmonellain lettuce.Salmonella-free lettuce was inoculated with heat-killedSalmonellaTyphimurium cells and stored at 4 °C. Bacterial DNA extracted from the sample was amplified by real-time PCR targeting theinvAgene. Our results indicate that DNA from the dead cells remained stable in lettuce for at least 8 d. To overcome this limitation, propidium monoazide (PMA), a dye that can selectively penetrate dead bacterial cells and cross-link their DNA upon light exposure, was combined with real-time PCR. Lettuce samples inoculated with different levels of dead or viableS.Typhimurium cells were treated or untreated with PMA before DNA extraction. Real-time PCR suggests that PMA treatment effectively prevented PCR amplification from as high as 108 CFU/g deadS.Typhimurium cells in lettuce. The PMA real-time PCR assay could detect viableSalmonellaat as low as 102 CFU/mL in pure culture and 103 CFU/g in lettuce. With 12-h enrichment,S.Typhimurium of 101 CFU/g in lettuce was detectable. In conclusion, the PMA real-time PCR assay provides an alternative to real-time PCR assay for accurate detection ofSalmonellain food. © 2011 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

   abstract = {A standardised profiling method based on liquid chromatography with diode array and electrospray ionisation/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI/MS) was used to identify 46 flavonoids and 17 caffeic acid derivatives in the aqueous methanol extract of Flos chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat) (Compositae), an important Chinese herb. Fifteen caffeoylquinic acids and 15 flavonoids were positively identified and the remaining compounds were provisionally identified. The detected phenolics were present at concentrations greater than 0.001% of the dry plant material. Many of these phenolics have been reported to have human health benefits. Twenty-five compounds, including C-glycosylated flavones and aliphatic acid-containing caffeoylquinic acids, are reported for the first time in chrysanthemum flower, and this comprehensive analysis of the phenolic components of herb Flos chrysanthemum will be helpful for the quality control of this herb and its products, and to understand the usage and function.},

   abstract = {Trichogramma pretiosum Riley and T. brassicae Bezdenko are common egg parasitoids of many lepidopteran pest species damaging vegetable, but their effectiveness can be severely curtailed by insecticide applications. To identify insecticides that are potentially compatible with these parasitoid species, the effects of indoxacarb and spinosad were bioassayed in the laboratory. The bioassays included exposure of adults to various aged residues on glass and cabbage leaf surfaces at different intervals after application, and direct spray on host eggs for effects on parasitism and development and mortality of parasitoid eggs, young and old larvae and pupae. The results showed that the glass- and leaf-surface residues of indoxacarb were harmless to both parasitoid species, whereas those of spinosad were moderately harmful to harmful to both parasitoid species depending on the rates used. The use of indoxacarb on host eggs did not affect significantly parasitism by both parasitoid species, whereas the higher rates of spinosad reduced parasitism. However, both insecticides did not affect immature development and adult emergence. Results from direct spray of host eggs with various immature stages inside showed that indoxacarb did not have significant effects on the egg, young and old larval stages and the pupal stage; whereas the high rates of spinosad when applied at the older larval and pupal stages significantly reduced adult emergence for both parasitoid species. Therefore, application of spinosad in an agro-ecosystem where Trichogramma are dominant should be carefully evaluated or avoided. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

   abstract = {The ecological implications on biological control of insecticidal transgenic plants, which produce crystal (Cry) proteins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), remain a contentious issue and affect risk assessment decisions. In this study, we used a unique system of resistant insects, Bt plants and a parasitoid to critically evaluate this issue. The effects of broccoli type (normal or expressing Cry1Ac protein) and insect genotype (susceptible or Cry1Ac-resistant) of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) were examined for their effects on the development and host foraging behavior of the parasitoid, Diadegma insulare (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) over two generations. Parasitism rate and development of D. insulare were not significantly different when different genotypes (Bt-resistant or susceptible) of insect host larvae fed on non-Bt broccoli plants. D. insulare could not discriminate between resistant and susceptible genotypes of P. xylostella, nor between Bt and normal broccoli plants with different genotypes of P. xylostella feeding on them. No D. insulare could emerge from Bt broccoli-fed susceptible and heterozygous P. xylostella larvae because these larvae were unable to survive on Bt broccoli. The parasitism rate, developmental period, pupal and adult weights of D. insulare that had developed on Bt broccoli-fed Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella larvae were not significantly different from those that developed on non-Bt broccoli-fed larvae. Female D. insulare emerged from Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella that fed on Bt plants could successfully parasitize P. xylostella larvae. The life parameters of the subsequent generation of D. insulare from P. xylostella reared on Bt broccoli were not significantly different from those from non-Bt broccoli. The Cry1Ac protein was detected in P. xylostella and in D. insulare when hosts fed on Bt broccoli. These results are the first to indicate that Cry1Ac did not harm the development or host acceptance of an important endoparasitoid after two generations of exposure. We suggest that using other Bt crops and resistant insect species would likely lead to similar conclusions about the safety of the presently used Bt proteins on parasitoids.},

An experiment was carried out to characterize the phytoextraction efficiency of two Jerusalem artichoke genotype (NY2 and NY5) in cadmium (Cd) contaminated soil. After 90 days of growth, NY5 had greater plant biomass and greater Cd accumulation in tissues than NY2. The chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were slightly higher when plants were grown in Cd-contaminated versus control soil. It implies that this examined NY2 and NY5 can extract more Cd than some hyperaccumulators, indicating that NY2 and NY5 can be applied to clean up Cd-contaminated soils. Compared with NY2, NY5 had higher phytoextraction potential due to more biomass and higher concentrations of Cd in tissues, and may therefore be the better candidates for phytoremediation in Cd-contaminated soil. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

   abstract = {Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been postulated as an alternative to sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for fresh-cut produce sanitization to avoid risks associated with chlorination by-products. Experiments were performed to determine the prevention of cross-contamination of fresh-cut lettuce by Escherichia coli using chlorine dioxide (3 mg/L) or sodium hypochlorite (100 mg/L) as sanitation agents. The efficacy of these sanitation solutions was evaluated simulating as much as possible the conditions of a fresh-cut processing line. Thus, to evaluate the potential risk of cross-contamination during pre-washing, inoculated fresh-cut lettuce was pre-washed and after that non-inoculated lettuce was then pre-washed in the same water. After this pre-washing, non-inoculated lettuce was cross-contaminated, changing from 0 to 3.4 log units of E. coli cells. During washing with sanitizers, none of the tested sanitation agents significantly reduced E. coli counts in both inoculated and cross-contaminated lettuce. These results suggest that when cross-contamination occurs, even if the event is recent, subsequent sanitation steps are inefficient for inactivating E. coli cells on the vegetable tissue. However, chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite solutions were able to inactivate most E. coli cells that passed from inoculated product to wash water. Therefore, they might be able to avoid cross-contamination between clean and contaminated product during the washing step. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs indicated that bacterial cells were mainly located in clusters or tissue stomata where they might be protected, which explains the low efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide solutions observed in this study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context the water plays an important role in the quality of minimally processed vegetables. We assessed the hygienic-sanitary quality of leafy vegetables and obtained data of interest to health surveillance agencies and public health. They were tested for the presence of total and faecal coliforms, and also parasitic protozoa and helminths. The vegetable samples were purchased in supermarkets of the Midwest of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. We performed bacteriological analyses of wash water samples using chromogenic substrates to obtain the most probable number of the coliform group at 35 °C and Escherichia coli. We used Hoffman’s spontaneous sedimentation technique for the parasitological analysis in order to check the occurrence of heavy and light helminths eggs and protozoan cysts. The analyses indicated the presence of coliforms, nematodes and freeliving protozoa, except for the last wash. We concluded that the washing process using running water and no active chlorine was not efficient in reducing the load of microorganisms in the vegetables. Therefore, intensive educational programmes should be implemented by health authorities to encourage hygienic-sanitary practices and risk reduction of food-borne diseases. © 2016, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

Uniquely, Escherichia coli was enumerated, after submersion, on both the outer and inner leaves and in a composite sample of lettuce. E. coli were enumerated using two techniques. Firstly, from samples of leaves - the direct method. Secondly, using an indirect method, where the E. coli concentrations were estimated from the volume of wastewater retained by the lettuce and the E. coli concentration of the wastewater. The results showed that different varieties of lettuce retained significantly different volumes of wastewater (p &lt; 0.01). No statistical differences (p &gt; 0.01) were detected between E. coli counts obtained from different parts of lettuce, nor between the direct and indirect enumeration methods. Statistically significant linear relationships were derived relating the E. coli concentration of the wastewater in which the lettuces were submerged to the subsequent E. coli count on each variety the lettuce. © IWA Publishing 2017.},

   abstract = {Utilization of nitrogen (N) element is a common practice used to reach profitable yields in horticultural crops and N supply can be used as a tool to manipulate the enhancement of phytochemicals and minerals in vegetable crops to address consumer-oriented quality production. Hence the study was aimed to investigate the effect of N application on leaf morphology, ascorbic acid content, phenolic acids, flavonoids, mineral content, and nitrate residues in three lettuce varieties (two green leafy lettuce, Multigreen 1 and Multigreen 3; one red leafy lettuce, Multired 4) grown in a closed hydroponic system (gravel-film) at harvest. Nitrogen was applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) at six different concentrations of 0, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 mg L−1. The results obtained during 2015 and 2016 seasons were similar and demonstrated variety dependent responses with respect to different N application rates. Multigreen 3 was more sensitive to N supply and showed higher amount of nitrate residue at harvest. Variety Multired 4 was less sensitive to N supply followed by Multigreen 1. Although N supply at 120 mg L−1 improved the yield and the number of leaves in Multigreen 3, overall 90 mg L−1 can be recommended for these lettuce varieties to improve the yield and the accumulation of ascorbic acid content, phenolic acids mainly caffeic, caftaric acids, quercetin (the important flavonoid in lettuce), and Fe and Mn contents. Furthermore, the concentration of 90 mg L−1 improved the antioxidant property (FRAP and ABTS+) and reduced the nitrate accumulation, ensuring safe food for consumers. © 2018 CAAS.

   abstract = {Spodoptera litura is an economic pest of different field crops including cauliflower. In the present study three commercial formulations of biorational insecticides viz., Bacillus thuringiensis (DiPel (R)), NPV (SpltNPV) and Flubendiamide (Belt (R)) evaluated (alone and in combination) against S. litura under field condition. Minimum plant infestation (7.60 +/- 0.40%) was observed three days after application when B. thuringiensis and flubendiamide were applied in combination (@0.5 kg/ha+75ml/ha, respectively). Maximum infestation (11.60 +/- 0.97%) was observed in SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml + B. thuringiensis @ 1.00 kg/ha. Similarly, five days after application minimum plant infestation was observed in B. thuringiensis and flubendiamide @0.5 kg/ha+75ml/ha (5.20 +/- 0.49%) and maximum in SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml + B. thuringiensis @ 1.00 kg/ha (8.80 +/- 0.49%). Whereas, minimum plant infestation was observed seven days after application where B. thuringiensis and flubendiamide were applied in combination @ 0.5 kg/ha+75ml/ha i.e. 2.80 +/- 0.49 % followed by B. thuringiensis @ 1.0 kg/ha + flubendiamide 480 SC @ 75ml/ha, SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml + B. thuringiensis @ 0.5 kg/ha, SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml + flubendiamide 480 SC @ 75ml/ha and SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml + B. thuringiensis @ 1.00 kg/ha i.e. 4.00 +/- 0.63, 4.40 +/- 0.40, 4.80 +/- 0.48 and 5.60 +/- 0.40 %, respectively. Whereas, B. thuringiensis @ 1.0 kg/ha, flubendiamide @ 75ml/ha, SpltNPV @ 1.0x10(9) POB/ml and B. thuringiensis @ 0.5 kg/ha were gave plant infestation 6.40 +/- 0.40, 6.80 +/- 0.49, 8.80 +/- 0.48 and 9.20 +/- 0.49%, respectively. After second application, lowest plant infestation was recorded in the plot treated with B. thuringiensis @ 0.5 kg/ha+flubendiamide 480SC @ 75ml/ha with plant infestation of 8.40 +/- 0.40, 5.60 +/- 0.40 and 2.20 +/- 0.40 % at three, five and seven days after application, respectively. However, all the insecticides reduced natural enemies (Chrysoperla carnea, ladybird beetles, and predatory bugs) populations in all the treatments. In conclusion, the results revealed the potential of Bt, NPV and flubendiamide for the management of S. litura. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential of these products against S. litura and negative impact on natural enemies under varying climatic conditions, and on different host crops.},

   abstract = {Small- and medium-size farms in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States use varied agricultural practices to produce leafy greens during spring and fall, but the impact of preharvest practices on food safety risk remains unclear. To assess farm-level risk factors, bacterial indicators, Salmonella enterica, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) from 32 organic and conventional farms were analyzed. A total of 577 leafy greens, irrigation water, compost, field soil, and pond sediment samples were collected. Salmonella was recovered from 2.2% of leafy greens (n = 369) and 7.7% of sediment (n = 13) samples. There was an association between Salmonella recovery and growing season (fall versus spring) (P = 0.006) but not farming system (organic or conventional) (P = 0.920) or region (P = 0.991). No STEC was isolated. In all, 10% of samples were positive for E. coli: 6%of leafy greens, 18% of irrigation water, 10% of soil, 38% of sediment, and 27% of compost samples. Farming system was not a significant factor for levels of E. coli or aerobic mesophiles on leafy greens but was a significant factor for total coliforms (TC) (P < 0.001), with higher counts from organic farm samples. Growing season was a factor for aerobic mesophiles on leafy greens (P = 0.004), with higher levels in fall than in spring. Water source was a factor for all indicator bacteria (P < 0.001), and end-of-line groundwater had marginally higher TC counts than source samples (P = 0.059). Overall, the data suggest that seasonal events, weather conditions, and proximity of compost piles might be important factors contributing to microbial contamination on farms growing leafy greens. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

During 2007, a random set of 194 samples, including 56 samples of FV and 138 samples of RTES, were analyzed for a total of 388 mycological determinations. Yeasts and moulds identification was carried out on 18/56 whole FV and 42/138 RTES. Yeasts were the predominant organisms in the FV (mean values: 6.20 log cfu g-1-8.00 log cfu g-) while moulds showed lower mean values (4.70 log cfu g-l-6.79 log cfu g-l). After processing, FV samples showed a statistically significant decreases (p-value <0.001) in the contamination of fungi. Most of the species identified were found both in the FV and RTES samples. Many of moulds species isolated belong to toxigenic genera Penicillium, Stachybotrys, Phoma, Fusarium indicating a potential mycotoxin production and a potential risk for consumers.},

   abstract = {The safety of agricultural products might be influenced by different factors such as climate change and global trends. An unequivocal consequence associated to climate change is global warming, with a prediction of an average increase in global temperature by 2100 between 1.8 and 4°C. Among other climate effects, the global warming will also be associated with extended dry periods. In fact, climate change is exacerbating water scarcity problems, which is an increasingly frequent phenomenon in the European Union. The water scarcity is likely to reduce the water availability for irrigation in dry areas, which might have an impact in the microflora of vegetable products such as fresh-cut leafy greens. Global trends, leading to the reduction of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, have increased the use of organic amendments and fertilizers, which are not produced by chemical synthesis. However, the use of organic waste and composting processes might represent a potential source of enteric contamination of fresh produce. In the present study, we have evaluated the impact of irrigation and stabilized organic wastes on the microbial quality of leafy greens to identify potential impacts of anticipated changes in climate and global change on food safety. It was observed that a reduction of about 25 and 50% of the irrigation doses regularly applied to Romaine lettuce during cultivation reduced the microbial load, including total coliforms when compared with excess water irrigation. On the other hand, the use of stabilized organic wastes at a rate of 2:225 t ha-1 significantly increased the populations of faecal coliforms in rocket leaves. These preliminary studies show the intrinsic vulnerability of the fresh produce chain to potential emerging microbial hazards associated with climate change and production trends. Thus, the risk evaluation of newly identified threats associated with the global trade system and anticipated climate change are very important to determine risk management strategies. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

   abstract = {Consumer demand for softer leaves with variation in taste, shape and colours has encouraged the development of new lettuce products of baby-sized leaves. The objective of this study was the comparison of whole-head lettuce, as the most common raw material for fresh-cut, with baby-leaf and multi-leaf as the newest baby-sized lettuce leaves. Lettuces (Lactuca sativa L) of the types Green Leaf, Red Leaf and Lollo Rosso were cultivated in the same field with different plant densities, under commercial conditions. Although baby-leaf was subjected to far less wound damage than the shredded lettuce from the whole-head, leaf age could play an important role in increasing respiration rate and determining postharvest quality. After 9-11 d of storage, minimally processed products from the three types of raw material showed good visual quality without differences among them. However, over the 12-d storage period, quality decreased to the limit of marketability mainly due to browning of the cut edge surface of the fresh-cut product from whole-heads and decay due to the soft tissue in the case of baby-leaves. Additionally, with the processing of whole-heads, the increase in cut-damage surfaces and availability of cell nutrients provided conditions that favoured the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and total coliforms compared to uncut surfaces of baby-sized leaves. The ratio between the oxidized and reduced forms of ascorbate (DHA/AA) increased 2-4 times after 9-11 d of storage. Furthermore, baby-sized leaves had higher phenolic contents than the shredded product from the whole-head which probably contributed to reaching a shelf-life of 11 d. In conclusion, the new green and red baby-sized leaves both at immature and mature stages provided high quality lettuce for the fresh-cut market, meeting specific requirements regarding visual quality, microbial load and high content of phytochemicals.

   abstract = {Reuse for agricultural purposes of aquaculture wastewater containing high levels of nutrients can be integrated into a water management strategy, in order to conserve water and alleviate water pollution problems. However, rather than nutrients, some contaminants in aquaculture wastewater may pose detrimental effects on plants being nourished. This study assessed the growth and accumulation of toxic substances of Brassica chinensis in response to Malachite Green (MG)-contaminated water. Plant seedlings were hydroponically grown with MG at 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L under ambient air conditions in the laboratory for 4 wk. Growth parameters—the number of leaves, plant height, leaf length and width, root length and dry mass of the plants—were compared with plants grown without MG (control). The concentrations at 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L affected the growth of the plants as measured by leaf length, plant height and leaf width generally to a lesser degree than the control plants and those grown at 1 mg/L MG (p < 0.05). The roots of plants were clearly affected by MG (average root length = 14.00 ± 1.17 cm, 14.50 ± 3.91 cm, 7.17 ± 1.52 cm and 6.58 ± 0.94 cm for plants from the control and treatments with MG at 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively, p < 0.001). The dry mass of treated plants (average dry mass = 1.22 ± 0.48 g/plant, 1.17 ± 0.27 g/plant and 0.86 ± 0.17 g/plant for treatments of MG at 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively) were lower than that of control plants (1.80 ± 0.73 g/plant) (p < 0.001). The increase in the oxalate content in the plant shoots suggested that the plants may accumulate substances that could be harmful to human health. Based on these results, it is proposed that the integration of hydroponic plant production with MG-contaminated water at a concentration not exceeding 1 mg/L can be applied without any reduction in the productivity of B. chinensis; however, the accumulation of toxic substances in plant tissues still needs to be identified. © 2017 Kasetsart University},

   abstract = {Scombrotoxin fish poisoning (SFP), also known as histamine (Hst) poisoning, has been associated with consumption of scombroid-type fish, including tuna and tuna fish products. Preparation of commercial tuna salad contaminated with Hstproducing bacteria (HPB), combined with time-temperature abuse, can present a food safety hazard. A potential source of HPB is raw ingredients, such as celery and onions. The objectives of this study were to determine whether raw ingredients can be a source of HPB and to ascertain the effects of storage time (up to 4 days or 4 weeks) and temperature (4, 10, 18, 25, 30°C) on growth and Hst production by high-HPB (>1,000 ppm of Hst) in tuna salad preparations. Pantoea-Erwinia, Erwinia persicinus, Erwinia spp., and Enterobacter pyrinus isolated from celery in this study were used to inoculate tuna salad and tuna salad with celery or onion. HPB numbers were 0.7 to 4.3 log most probable number per g higher in the presence of celery or onion versus plain tuna salad (3:1 tuna:mayonnaise). E. pyrinus-inoculated plain tuna salad and tuna salad with celery and onion had >500 ppm of Hst after 2 days at 30°C and 4 days at 25°C. E. pyrinus-inoculated salad with celery and onion had >500 ppm of Hst after 4 days at 18°C and 2 weeks at 10°C. Raw celery can introduce HPB into tuna salad, which can cause SFP if the product is time-temperature abused. Tuna salad products must be refrigerated at ≤4°C to prevent growth and Hst production by the HPB used in this study, to protect consumers from potential SFP.},

   abstract = {During October, November and December 2011 (when highest sales of Agri-Hub fresh produce are observed), irrigation water, compost, lettuce and spinach sampled from four different farmer cooperatives supplying the local Agri-Hub in uMbumbulu (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) were analyzed monthly for the presence of total and fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli using the most probable number (MPN) technique. The pH values for all irrigation water samples analyzed were within the acceptable range of 6.5-8.5 for agricultural use. Fecal coliform levels were <1,000 MPN per 100 mL irrigation water and <1,000 MPN per g of compost. The vegetables produced by Agri-Hub small-scale farmers met the requirements for total coliforms of <200/g set by the South African Department of Health at the time of sampling. E. coli MPN values for irrigation water and vegetables were below the limit of detection. In addition, the farming practices of 73 farmers were assessed via a survey. The results revealed that more than 40% of farmers used microbiologically safe tap water for irrigation and that trained farmers have a significantly better understanding of the importance of production hygiene than untrained farmers. These results reiterate the importance of interventions that build capacity in the area of food safety and hygiene of small-scale farmers for market access of formal value chains. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {The role and importance of the true slime moulds (mycetozoans, Mycetozoa, formerly Myxomycetes) for agriculture and food industry are poorly documented, most probably because of a low popularity of these "macroscopic microorganisms" among researchers in the past. Here we report probably for the first time the massive occurrence of true slime moulds in their vegetative, plasmodial form in a product intended for direct consumption, i.e. in a household hydroponic culture of garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.). The plasmodia gradually produced numerous, stalked or sessile sporangia and plasmodiocarps, which made it possible to identify them as Didymium species complex (the stalked sporangia) and Didymium difforme (Pers.) Gray (the sessile sporangia and plasmodiocarps). The mycetozoans were transferred to in vitro culture where they were maintained for several weeks on oat flour. We briefly discuss the importance of this observation from the point of view of biochemical interactions between the plant and the true slime moulds in a general context of slime mould biology. Our observation indicates that the presence of mycetozoan material in food products may be frequent, while its influence on food safety and quality remains unknown. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In the majority of cases, the aerobic colony count determined was within the range from 10 8 to 10 10 cfu/g, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria counts rang ed from 10 6 to 10 8 cfu/g, while yeasts and moulds counts were between 10 3 and 10 5 cfu/g. Among Enterobacteriaceae, the following were isolated: Klebsiella, typical Enterobacter, typical Escherichia coli, atypical Escherichia coli, and Serratia. In the most cases, neither washing with tap water (30 s) nor washing with 5- minute dipping in brine (5 %) prior to washing significantly affected the reduction in the microbial contamination of the products studied. In all the bacterial groups under analysis, this reduction did not exceed 1 log cycle. Since the consumers are not able to effectively decrease the level of microbial contamination, it is necessary to do it as early as at the stage of production.},

The ingestion of vegetables contaminated by human waste is a major route of transmission of these infections. There is little research on strategies for control of food contamination and, as Brazil is a country with poor sanitation, care of the production and handling of foods, especially those eaten raw, should be intensified. The aim of this study was to determine qualitatively the presence of evolutionary forms of intestinal parasites in lettuce sold in Anápolis- GO. For analysis were used 62 samples of lettuce (Lactuva sativa) from traditional cultivation and 17 from hydroponic cultivation. All were acquired at random during the months of September 2009 to January 2010, with 39 samples from several supermarkets, 20 in free markets and 20 in retail shops in different parts of town. The analysis showed the presence of intestinal parasites in all samples, indicating poor sanitary in the production, probably due to water contamination used in the cultivation. Anápolis is a great city and presents good socioeconomic conditions, however, relevant measures should be taken by relevant agencies to try will better sanitation.},

In this study we investigated the interaction of moderate UV-B radiation and temperature on these compounds. Kale plants were grown at daily mean temperatures of 5 or 15 degrees C and were exposed to five subsequent daily doses (each 0.25 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) of moderate UV-B radiation at 1 d intervals. Of 20 phenolic compounds, 11 were influenced by an interaction of UV-B radiation and temperature, e.g., monoacylated quercetin glycosides. Concomitantly, enhanced mRNA expression of flavonol 3'- hydroxylase showed an interaction of UV-B and temperature, highest at 0.75 kJ m(-2) and 15 degrees C. Kaempferol glycosides responded diversely and dependent on, e.g., the hydroxycinnamic acid residue. Compounds containing a catechol structure seem to be favored in the response to UV-B. Taken together, subsequent exposure to moderate UV-B radiation is a successful tool for enhancing the flavonoid profile of plants, and temperature should be considered.},

The extract activity against Staphylococcus aureus was better during incubation at 35°C than at 10 and 4°C. The extract exhibited excellent stability in response to heat and pH treatments. The extract was incorporated into homemade salad dressing and evaluated for its antibacterial, physical, chemical, and sensory properties. A more than 1-log reduction in S. aureus counts was observed compared with the control. Examination of lipid oxidation revealed that the extract could retard the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the salad dressing. The magnitude of the storage changes were minimal, and there were no significant differences in the appearance, color, taste, and overall acceptability ranking between samples supplemented with E. americana extract and the control samples. Based on all sensory attributes, the sensory evaluation from 0 to 16 days indicated that products with each extract concentration were acceptable. The extract from E. americana is a promising novel additive that can be used to improve the quality and safety of homemade salad dressing.

In this study watercress was artificially contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Their survival was evaluated after blanching, frozen storage and temperature fluctuations of the frozen product. The blanching caused a reduction of about 2 log cfu per gram of product of total viable count (TVC) and about 1.7 and 1.3 log cfu per gram of product of P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis, respectively. P. aeruginosa seemed to be more sensitive to temperature abuses than E. faecalis. After 3 months, TVC was still observed with a reduction of about 3 log cfu per gram of product. At the end of the study, exposure to freeze-thaw cycles resulted in death or injury of the microorganisms. These findings on the behaviour of two microorganisms of concern in frozen watercress will help improving the safety and cold chain settings for this product. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.},

   abstract = {Scope: To study the effect of residual myrosinase (MYR) activity in differently processed broccoli on sulforaphane (SR) and iberin (IB) formation, bioavailability, and excretion in human volunteers. Methods and results: Five different broccoli products were obtained with similar glucoraphanin (GR) and glucoiberin (GI) content, yet different MYR activity. Excretion of SR and IB conjugates in urine were determined in 15 participants after ingestion of the broccoli products. A reduction of 80% of MYR in the product did not cause differences in the total amount of SR and IB found in urine compared to the product with 100% MYR. Complete inactivation of MYR gave the lowest total amount of SR and IB in urine (10 and 19%). A residual MYR of only 2% in the product gave an intermediate amount (17 and 29%). The excretion half-lives of SR and IB conjugates were comparable for all the products (2.5 h on average), although the maximum excretion peak times were clearly shorter when the residual MYR was higher (2.3-6.1 h). Conclusion: For the first time, the effect of residual MYR activity on isothiocyanate bioavailability was systematically and quantitatively studied. Processing conditions have a large effect on the kinetics and bioavailability of isothiocyanates from broccoli.},

Nevertheless, some challenging issues still remain unsolved and new ones have recently emerged, such as the increase in outbreaks of foodborne diseases originating from the consumption of meals at catering facilities. The study described in this article was aimed at evaluating the microbiological quality of mixed fresh-cut salads at an Italian university canteen operating in conformity with the hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system. The effectiveness of the preventive and corrective measures taken was also assessed with respect to the frequency of unsatisfactory salad samples. During the investigation, E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes were never detected. By contrast, a high number of samples exceeded the mandatory or suggested limits for food processing hygiene (in terms of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulfite-reducing clostridia counts). Despite the introduction of a series of preventive and corrective actions, the results were only partially satisfactory; this was most likely due to the impossibility of having available an adequate level of human resources that are indispensable to correctly putting the HACCP procedures into daily practice.},

   abstract = {Lettuce is consumed raw in salads and is susceptible to microbial contamination through environment, agricultural practices, and its morphology, thus, a potential vehicle for food-borne illness. This study investigated the effect of adoption of food safety and hygienic practices by lettuce farmers on the microbial safety of field sourced lettuce in Lagos State, Nigeria. Ten structured questionnaires were administered randomly to 10 lettuce farmers to assess food safety and hygienic practices (FSH). Two farmers who practice FSH and two farmers who do not practice NFSH were finally used for this study. Samples of ready-to-harvest lettuce, manure applied, and irrigation water were obtained for a period of five months (August – December 2013) and analyzed for total plate count (TPC), total coliform count (TCC), Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. counts. Result of microbial analyses of lettuce samples was compared with international microbiological specification for ready-to-eat foods. Results showed that the range of TPC on lettuce was 6.00 to 8.11 LogCFU/g from FSH farms and TPC of lettuce samples from NFSH farms ranged from 6.66 to 13.64 LogCFU/g. 1.49 to 4.85LogCFU/g were TCC ranges from lettuce samples obtained from FSH farms while NFSH farms had TCC ranging between 3.95 and 10.86 LogCFU/g, respectively. The range of isolated pathogen count on lettuce from FSH and NFSH farms exceeded the international safety standard; there was a significant difference in the microbial count of lettuce from FSH farms and NFSH farms. This study concludes that the lettuce samples obtained did not pass the international microbial safety standards. FSH compliance is a major determinant of the microbial safety of lettuce. Hence, the institution of FSH on farm to improve microbial safety of lettuce produced for public consumption is emphasized. © 2016 The Authors.

   abstract = {In the 'Integrated Control Concept', Stern et al. emphasized that, although insecticides are necessary for agricultural production, they should only be used as a last resort and as a complement to biological control. They argued that selective insecticide use should only be attempted after it has been determined that insect control with naturally occurring biotic agents is not capable of preventing economic damage. However, they concluded their seminal paper by emphasizing that integrated control will not work where natural enemies are inadequate or where economic thresholds are too low to rely on biological control. Thus, it is no surprise that insect control in high-value, fresh-market lettuce crops grown in the desert southwest have relied almost exclusively on insecticides to control a complex of mobile, polyphagous pests. Because lettuce and leafy greens are short-season annual crops with little or no tolerance for insect damage or contamination, biological control is generally considered unacceptable. High expectations from consumers for aesthetically appealing produce free of pesticide residues further forces vegetable growers to use chemical control tactics that are not only effective but safe. Consequently, scientists have been developing integrated pest management (IPM) programs for lettuce that are aimed at reducing the economic, occupational and dietary risks associated with chemical controls of the past. Most of these programs have drawn upon the integrated control concept and promote the importance of understanding the agroecosystem, and the need to sample for pest status and use action thresholds forcost-effective insect control. More recently, pest management programs have implemented newly developed, reduced-risk chemistries that are selectively efficacious against key pests. This paper discusses the influence that the integrated control concept, relative to zero-tolerance market standards and other constraints, has had on the adoption of pest management in desert lettuce crops. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.},

This study investigated the antibacterial activities of the combined treatment of cinnamon leaf oil emulsion containing cetylpyridinium chloride or benzalkonium chloride (CLC and CLB, respectively) as a cationic surfactant and ultrasound (US) against Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on endive. The combined treatment of CLC or CLB with US reduced the population of L. monocytogenes by 1.58 and 1.47 log colony forming units (CFU)/g, respectively, and that of E. coli O157:H7 by 1.60 and 1.46 log CFU/g, respectively, as compared with water washing treatment. The reduction levels of both pathogens were higher than those observed with 0.2 mg/ml sodium hypochlorite. In addition, the combined treatment showed no effect on the quality of the fresh-cut endive (FCE). In particular, the degree of browning in FCE was less for the treatment group than for the control and water washing treatment groups. Thus, cationic surfactant-based cinnamon leaf oil emulsions combined with US may be an effective washing treatment for the microbial safety of FCE. © 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

These studies allow for assessment of the existing and potential hazards resulting from toxic influence of heavy metals on water environment and human health. The concentration of research elements was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Results indicate that the concentration of heavy metals in the examined bottom sediments remained within the limits of the geochemical background for majority of the determined elements. The concentrations of Zn and Cu, sporadically exceeded the level of the geochemical background at the stations in the central part of the city, and in the case of Ni in all researched positions. Following the LAWA classification, the bottom sediments within the Słupsk area were classified in the first class, as slightly contaminated. It was found the G. maxima underground sprouts accumulated several times more of Zn, Mn, Cu and Ni than their aboveground sprouts. The indices of quality of the tested bottom sediments and the enrichment factors of the sprouts with heavy metals indicate that the Słupia River is the least contaminated along the segments of the river with a low or moderate transformation of the river bed and the largest load of Zn, Mn, Cu and Ni is found at the stations with a high transformation of the river bed. The strong positive correlations between the concentrations of Mn in bottom sediments and the level this element in aboveground and underground sprouts indicate that the sprouts of Glyceria maxima are potentially useful in biomonitoring environmental contamination with Mn. © 2018, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

A log-normal probability distribution function was fitted to a large database from a comprehensive monitoring of an experimental pond system to account for variability in Escherichia coli concentration in irrigation water. Crop contamination levels were estimated using predictive models derived from field experiments involving the irrigation of several crops with different effluent qualities. Data on daily intake of salad crops were obtained from a national survey in Brazil. Ten thousand-trial Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate human health risks associated with the use of wastewater for irrigating low- and high-growing crops. The use of effluents containing 103-104 E. coli per 100 ml resulted in median rotavirus infection risk of approximately 10 -3 and 10-4 pppy when irrigating, respectively, low- and high-growing crops; the corresponding 95th percentile risk estimates were around 10-2 in both scenarios. Sensitivity analyses revealed that variations in effluent quality, in the assumed ratios of pathogens to E. coli, and in the reduction of pathogens between harvest and consumption had great impact upon risk estimates. © IWA Publishing 2013.},

However an increased number of food safety outbreaks associated with fresh-cut produce require investigations into novel microbial decontamination methods infresh-cut lettuce products. This study investigated the effects of a novel technique using ozone micro bubbles (O3-MBs) on microbial control and quality of fresh-cut 'Cos' lettuce. Fresh-cut 'Cos' lettuce leaves were washed in O3-MBs (0.5 ppm) for 5 min at ambient temperature and compared with chlorinated water (NaOCl, 100 mg L-1, 5 min). For total bacteria counts, coliform counts and yeast and mould, O3-MBs treatment resulted into a 1-2 log reduction, which was similar to the result achieved by 100 mg L-1 chlorinated water. The amount of phenolic compounds of the lettuce was reduced by O3-MBs treatments. Washing with O3-MBs also inhibited PPO activity for up to six days of storage at 4°C which is correlated with a lower amount of quinone content during storage. An inhibitory effect of browning enzyme and substrate resulted in a lower browning symptom of fresh-cut lettuce during storage. These results indicate that O3-MBs could be an alternative sanitizer to chlorine for fresh-cut lettuce due to a bacterial inhibitory effect and retention of sensorial quality and browning control.},

   abstract = {Cabbage is preferentially consumed in natura and in many cases is produced conventionally, leaving traces of chemical residues which can cause direct effects on the health of the consumer and the farmer. The aim was to evaluate the influence of high dilutions preparations on growth and production under organic system of cabbage evaluating seedlings and plants in field. The study was composed of five experiments with nine treatments and four replications. Three greenhouse and two field experiments were carried out in a randomized complete block design. The treatments were prepared of Arnica montana, Silicea terra, Carbo vegetabilis and Sulphur at 6CH and 30CH in high dilutions, water being used as control. Sulphur at 6CH increased the height and root length in comparison with a control, in two of the three experiments with cabbage seedlings. Silicea terra at 30CH and Sulphur at 6CH increased the production and the dry mass of cabbage heads. Arnica montana at 6CH and 30CH also increased the dry mass. In conclusion, Sulphur at 6CH stands out as promising for improving the quality of cabbage seedlings as much as the production and dry mass of cabbage heads in field conditions, these last characteristics also being improved by Silicea terra at 30CH.},

   abstract = {Sprout-related outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are increasingly becoming a food safety concern. Different pathogenic microorganisms that originate from sprout seeds are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of such outbreaks. Therefore, in order to decontaminate and also to enhance the germination of seeds, the applications of non-thermal plasma based techniques are increasingly being investigated in the field of agricultural science as an alternative to conventional pre-germination treatments. This work was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of corona discharge plasma jet (CDPJ) for microbial decontamination of rapeseed seeds, and also studied the plasma treatment effect on the seed germination and physicochemical properties of sprouts (grown from the plasma-treated seeds). Aerobic bacteria, molds and yeast, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. were detected as contaminants in the seeds. All the detected microorganisms were reduced in the range of 1.2–2.2 log CFU/g upon the CDPJ treatment for 3 min. The inactivation patterns are better explained using pseudo-first-order kinetics. The plasma treatment of seeds up to 2 min showed positive effects on their germination rate and seedling growth. Physicochemical and sensory characteristics of rape sprouts were unaffected due to the CDPJ treatment of their respective seeds. Therefore, the CDPJ treatment of rapeseed seeds has not only reduced the seed microbial load, but also contributed to the enhancement of their germination rate and seedling growth, without adversely affecting the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of their corresponding sprouts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Sprout-related foodborne disease outbreaks are increasingly becoming a concern for food safety. The primary sources of microbial contamination in ready-to-eat sprouts are contaminated seeds, which are improperly disinfected prior to sprouting. In recent years, the application of nonthermal plasmas for seed decontamination is increasingly being investigated as a substitute to regular pre-germination treatments. The present study was intended to evaluate the potentiality of corona discharge plasma jet (CDPJ) for decontaminating microorganisms on radish seeds and to determine the plasma exposure effects on the seed germination as well as physicochemical properties of sprouts grown from the CDPJ-treated seeds. Microbial contaminants, namely, aerobic bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and molds and yeast were detected in the seeds. All the microorganisms found in the seed samples were reduced in the range of 1.2–2.1 log CFU/g upon treatment using the CDPJ for 3 min. Pseudo-first-order kinetics provides the best fit to the microbial inactivation patterns. The plasma seed treatment for up to 2 min showed beneficial effects on seed germination rate and growth of seedlings. Compared to untreated controls, sprouts grown from the CDPJ-treated seeds exhibited no significant changes in the levels of moisture (mean range 85.45–87.51%), reducing sugars (0.547–0.550%), total phenolic content (6.14–6.29 μg GAL/g), and DPPH radical scavenging activity (78.03–78.60%). Sensory characteristics of radish sprouts grown from the plasma-treated (up to 2 min) seeds were not significantly different from controls. In conclusion, the CDPJ treatment of radish seeds for 2 min not only decreased the seed microbial counts but also led to the improvement of their germination rate and seedling growth, without negatively affecting the physicochemical and sensory properties of their corresponding sprouts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The contact time of ozonated water used to minimize the population of coliforms, total bacteria, and yeast and molds, and to maintain the quality of fresh-cut broccoli florets was investigated. Fresh-cut broccoli florets (Brassica oleraceae L.) were dipped in water treated with ozone gas at a concentration of 2,500 mg.h-1 for 5, 10, and 15 min, Ozone concentrations in water were then detected as follows: 0.56, 1.00, and 1.50 ppm, respectively. Fresh-cut broccoli florets dipped in tap water for 2 min were used as the control. All samples were then packaged in sealed polyvinylchloride (PVC) boxes and stored for 6 d at 4°C. Application of ozonated water for 15 min significantly reduced coliforms, total bacteria, and yeast and mold counts by 1.20, 2.50, and 1.80 log10 CFU.g-1, respectively, when compared with that of the control. However, ozonated water treatments impacted fresh-cut broccoli quality by decreasing the chlorophyll contents, L* value, and hue angle; however, these significant changes were not observed by consumers. The visual quality and visual color of fresh-cut broccoli evaluated by the sensory panel in both ozonated water and non-ozonated water treatments were not significantly different. © ISHS 2013.},

The first group of fresh-cut broccoli was immersed in air-ozonated water (containing 0.56 ppm ozone [O3]) for 5 min and remained immersed in this water for 5 min (i.e., low O3 concentration and long contact time; LL). The second group of fresh-cut broccoli was immersed in O2 gas-ozonated water (containing 1.60 ppm O3) for 5 min and remained immersed in this water for 3 min (i.e., high O3 concentration and short-contact time; HS). Fresh-cut broccoli treated with tap water served as the control. All samples were stored at 4°C for 6 days. The results revealed that washing fresh-cut broccoli with ozonated water (LL and HS) and tap water (control) reduced the amount of microbes compared with the initial microbial loads of unwashed fresh-cut broccoli. HS was the most effective treatment with regard to reducing aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and yeasts and molds throughout storage to ranges of 1.41-2.61, 0.55-1.75, and 1.46-1.71 log CFU.g-1FW, respectively. Furthermore, this treatment did not have negative effects on color (lightness, a*, b*, and hue angle values), chlorophyll content, or sensory attributes (overall visual quality, visible color, and odor). The LL treatment reduced the microbial counts in fresh-cut broccoli on the first day after the treatment; however, the quality and sensory attributes of the LL-treated broccoli were significantly decreased compared with the control. The results indicate that treating fresh-cut broccoli with water ozonated with a high concentration of O3 (1.60 ppm) for 5 min followed by immersion in the same water for 3 min reduces natural microbial contamination without any negative effects on the quality or sensory attributes of the broccoli.},

   abstract = {Effects of ozonised water, gaseous ozone exposure, and their combined treatments on microbiological and qualitative parameters of two globe artichoke cultivars (Violet de Provence and Romanesco clone C3) were studied during storage at 4 °C. At the end of this period, microbial counts were significantly lowered. Considering the qualitative parameters, ozone can be successfully applied to cv. Romanesco clone C3 without significantly increasing the respiration rate, while it could determine the acceleration of senescence in Violet de Provence heads. The storage under ozone-enriched atmosphere improved the initial polyphenol content in Violet de Provence, while for Romanesco clone C3 it seemed to be opportune to interrupt the ozonisation within the 4th day of storage for preventing excessive losses of polyphenol content. The ascorbic acid reduction, for both cultivars, was significantly increased by postharvest treatments with gaseous ozone suggesting to reduce, also in this case, the exposure days to the gas. Industrial relevance The globe artichoke is a herbaceous crop native to the Mediterranean basin, which gives an important contribution both to agricultural economy and to human health due to the high content of promoting nutrients. Unfortunately, globe artichoke heads are very perishable because of their high respiratory activity, susceptibility to weight loss, and microbial decay. In particular, fungal decay is one of the main factors affecting the postharvest quality of globe artichoke and, so far, it is controlled by the application of chemical fungicides. However, resistance phenomena in microbial populations, growing public health and environmental concerns are urging for the use of alternative treatments. Among them, ozone is one of the most promising technologies from the health and environmental points of view for its spontaneous decomposition to non-toxic product. In addition, it has emerged as a potential antimicrobial agent in the post-harvest treatment of fruits and vegetables and is able to decompose pesticides and chemical residues. On the other side, the effect of ozone treatments on other qualitative parameters, including the level of antioxidant compounds, is highly dependent on the commodity and storage conditions. In this view, the combined water ozonisation/O3-atmosphere storage represents innovative and applicable postharvest treatments for globe artichoke, whose exposure time and concentrations need to be customized for each cultivar. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Initial levels of S. aureus on wheat, lentil and mung bean were 4.86, 4.24 and 4.23 log colony forming units/g, respectively. Hydrosol treatments reduced S. aureus numbers significantly (P < 0.05) depending on treatment time while the pathogen was not detected on mung bean soaked in the thyme hydrosol for 40 min. Sensitivity of S. Typhimurium was higher than S. aureus and thyme hydrosol achieved elimination of Salmonella on all of the seeds.

   abstract = {During the last decades food borne outbreaks associated with consumption of raw vegetables have been increasing and green leafy vegetables seem to be the most frequently implicated products. In order to determine the microbial quality and the incidence of the major food borne pathogens in Minimally Processed (MP) salads commercialized in Portugal, a survey was conducted in Lisbon Retail Markets, from July 2007 to August 2008, to determine microbial contamination loads and identify potential pathogenic bacteria. A total of 151 samples were purchased from 2 supermarkets: 38 romaine lettuce, 12 various spinach and 101 mixed salads with three or four different ingredients. The samples were tested for aerobic psychotropic micro-organisms (APM), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., presumptive Bacillus cereus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens counts as well as for presence of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157. Samples were also evaluated for taste quality. The results showed that APM counts of romaine lettuce and mixed salads had a similar median, respectively, 6.2 and 6.5 log cfu/g and mixed spinach had the highest one (7.6 log cfu/g). The median value found for Enterobacteriaceae was 5.44 log cfu/g. Only four samples showed positive result for E. coli (2.65%) but just one (0.8%) had a slightly higher load of contamination. Although the percentage and levels of contamination loads were low, these mustn't be ignored, for the reason that the strains in three of the samples belong to VTEC group (1.99%). E. coli O157, Salmonella spp. and C. perfringens weren't detected in any sample. For the enumeration of Listeria spp., two samples (1.32%) had presence of Listeria innocua and L. monocytogenes had an incidence of 0.66%. A. hydrophila was identified in 11 samples (7.28%), and in 8 of them with considerable counts (&gt;105). Contamination with B. cereus was found in 22.7% of samples analyzed, though in small numbers, which doesn't represent a major concern to food safety. All isolated strains were assessed for its potential toxin production and it was found that 40% of these strains had this ability. Results from sensory panel showed organoleptic differences in salads during its shelf-life period. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The decontamination and sanitation methods currently used are mainly antimicrobial ineffective, generate high costs with a high consumption of water and chemicals (additives). As an alternative, non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure could be a versatile tool. Therefore, a pilot-scaled set-up based on a microwave-plasma source that generates plasma processed air (PPA), a gaseous mixture which contains manifold RNS-based chemical compounds gaining, among others, the antimicrobial effectivity of that mixture. The PPA was introduced to a water-processing device (WPD) to enrich tap water. By this way, plasma processed tap water (PPtW), which can be applied for the decontamination of packaging material, fresh produce and processing equipment, was generated. This is a new and innovative method for the generation of antimicrobial active plasma processed water. In our experiments, the native contamination of fresh-cut lettuce treated with PPtW in a common washing process and the microbial load of the washing water itself was investigated. Different treatment scenarios showed the influence of PPtW to the fresh-cut lettuce and the washing water as well as the hygienic problems of recontamination during the washing process. The characteristics of plasma and its generated cocktail of long living chemical compounds in air and in water leading to a significant bacterial inactivation and offering a wide range of possible applications. Industrial relevance: The safety, quality and shelf life of freshly cut vegetables greatly depend on the microbial load, especially with phyto and human pathogens, of the produce as well as the hygienic design of production device and good handling and production practice. This study shows that the application of PPW/PPtW, as a promising non-thermal sanitation technology, enables the inactivation of native contamination on fresh-cut lettuce in industrial relevant level. It further describes the impact of the necessity of hygienic environment during production to avoid cross- and re-contamination. The results contribute to the understanding and product-specificity of PPW-induced effects on safety, quality and shelf life of fresh cut lettuce and could be a basis for a possible industrial implementation and complement of common technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

The study aimed to investigate the response of two celery cultivars, i.e. local Egyptian Cv" Balady" and imported Cv "Utah Tall 52-70", to complete or partial organic nitrogen replacement. Five fertilizing strategies {100% mineral nitrogen "M" (ammonium nitrate), 100 % Organic nitrogen "O" (compost El-Nile), 75 % M + 25 % O, 50 % M + 50 % O and 25 % M + 75 O} were conducted on both cultivars. Plant height, leaves number, fresh & dry weights/ plant, fresh yield/Feddan, Vitamin C, carotenoides, essential oil content & composition and nitrate accumulation in leaves were determined in the vegetative marketing stage. Results indicated that replacement of 25 to 5o % of celery nitrogen requirement by organic sources may be efficiently carried out without any loose of celery yield. Moreover, alternating mineral nitrogen by organic sources resulted in some improvement of essential oil composition, flavor and reduced nitrate accumulation in celery fresh yield. Accordingly, it could be an eco-friendly recommendation to alternate up to half nitrogen nutrition by organic source, in order to reduce the environmental harmful residues, nitrate accumulation in the celery vegetative yield and also improve its flavor, nutrient value and health impacts.},

   abstract = {Sprouts have gained popularity worldwide due to their nutritional values and health benefits. The fact that their consumption has been associated with numerous outbreaks of foodborne illness threatens the $250 million market that this industry has established in the United States. Therefore, sprout manufacturers have utilized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended application of 20,000 ppm of calcium hypochlorite solution to seeds before germination as a preventative method. Concentrations of up to 200 ppm of chlorine wash are also commonly used on sprouts. However, chlorine-based treatment achieves on average only 1- to 3-log reductions in bacteria and is associated with negative health and environmental issues. The search for alternative strategies has been widespread, involving chemical, biological, physical, and hurdle processes that can achieve up to 7-log reductions in bacteria in some cases. The compilation here of the current scientific data related to these techniques is used to compare their efficacy for ensuring the microbial safety of sprouts and their practicality for commercial producers. Of specific importance for alternative seed and sprout treatments is maintaining the industry-accepted germination rate of 95% and the sensorial attributes of the final product. This review provides an evaluation of suggested decontamination technologies for seeds and sprouts before, during, and after germination and concludes that thermal inactivation of seeds and irradiation of sprouts are the most practical stand-alone microbial safety interventions for sprout production. © International Association for Food Protection.},

A total of 15 random samples were analyzed every other day of the three different places that sell vegetables a grocery store, a supermarket and a vegetable garden during the month of May 2011. The parasites and / or commensals found in lettuce were Entamoeba coli (67%), Entamoeba histolytica (20%), Giardia sp (13%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (7%). The analysis showed the presence of parasites and / or commensals in all samples, except in the cultivated garden which showed poor sanitary conditions, probably due to contamination in the shipping and handling by third parties in supermarket and grocery store. The parasite monitoring sanitary conditions of vegetables sold in urban environments becomes relevant for preventive measures to avoid the continued parasitic cycle and possible future health complications.},

   abstract = {Food safety is an important issue to reduce consumers' risk of foodborne outbreaks. Vegetables have been found as a source of contamination from pathogenic microorganisms. The best method to reduce pathogens from vegetable is to prevent contamination. Therefore, the washing process is a solution to decrease the microbial load on vegetables and to provide consumer safety. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of washing with ozonated and chlorinated water on the reduction of microbial load and on the shelf life of fresh-cut cauliflower and fresh-cut basil compared with tap water and unwashed controls and to analyse the effect of these treatments on sensory evaluation. Washing fresh-cut cauliflower with ozonated water (c(O3) = 0.31-0.35 ppm, t = 15 min) reduced the total plate count (TPC) and E. coli count (EC) by 1.8 and 1.88 log CFU ml-1, respectively. Ozonated water was more effective than chlorinated water to reduce the microbial load at the same conditions, while chlorinated water washing resulted in a reduction of 0.6 and 0.99 log CFU ml-1 for TPC and EC, respectively. Washing basil with ozonated water reduced TPC and EC by 0.39 and 0.66 log CFU ml-1, respectively. This reduction of microbial load was similar to the result of chlorinated water washing (0.23 and 0.37 log CFU ml-1 for TPC and EC, respectively). Fresh-cut cauliflower and basil were stored at 3 and 8°C and stored for 18 and 5 d, respectively. The overall acceptance of fresh-cut cauliflower from ozonated washing had a higher score than from chlorinated washing. However, the overall visual quality of fresh-cut basil from ozonated washing was similar to chlorinated washing. This result shows the potential of ozonated washing method to substitute traditional chlorinated washing to prolong the shelf-life of fresh-cut vegetable.},

Organic western kale was purchased from a major supplier and transported to the laboratory by refrigerated truck. The kale was washed with tap water and packed in various types of bags: perforated PE bag, perforated zip bag and anti-fog bag. All treatments were held at 10°C for 10 days. The perforated zip bag and anti-fog bag significantly reduced weight loss compared to the perforated PE bag. Chlorophyll loss and the decline of hue angle was less in kale held in the anti-fog bag. The respiration rate, ethylene production, and vitamin C were not significantly different among the three treatments. This result indicated that the perforated zip bag or anti-fog bag can maintain the quality of organic kale for up to 8 days at 10°C.},

   abstract = {Along with the popularity of raw sprouts in the food baskets, the outbreaks associated with the consumption of the contaminated sprouts increased. In the present study, the antibacterial effect of the essential oil of Satureja khuzistanica in reducing the Escherichia coliO157:H7 population on alfalfa seeds prior to sprouting was evaluated. The essential oil (EO) was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Alfalfa seeds were inoculated with E.coli O157:H7. The inoculated seeds were then treated with different concentrations of the essential oil of S.khuzistanica. The surviving populations of E.coliO157:H7 were enumerated by direct plating of the seeds on tryptic soy agar. The oil was rich in carvacrol. Direct surface-plating on selective media showed the treatment resulted in a significant (P0.05) reduction of E.coliO157:H7 population in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing the washing time revealed a significant effect on reduction of E.coliO157:H7 population. The considerable antibacterial activity of the oil might be due to the high concentration of carvacrol. As the S.khuzistanicaEO did not adversely affect alfalfa seed germination and had a strong antibacterial activity, the oil might be used as a natural antimicrobial product to overcome bacterial contamination of sprouts without compromising the viability. Practical Application During the past decades, existing of chemical antibacterial has become increasingly unpopular in food industries. Consumers presume that these chemicals are threats to human health, because of their carcinogenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and environmental contaminations. For these reasons, nowadays, using of organic products is becoming more popular. Moreover, many foodborne pathogens are genetically adapted to synthetic antimicrobial compounds, thereby reducing the efficacy of such preventatives. It has been known that EOs have antimicrobial activities, rendering these natural products as good alternatives to synthetic bactericides. S.khuzistanica, with high concentration of carvacrol which is classified as GRAS (generally regarded as safe), could be one of these potential alternatives. This antimicrobial property favors its application in food industries as a reasonably safe agent. The confirmed antibacterial activities of S.khuzistanica, recommends its possible application in the field of food preservation for prolonging the shelf life of sprouts during postharvest and marketing processes.},

   abstract = {White cabbage outer leaves, which are usually discarded both during industrial processing and selling in a consumer market, have proven to be a good source of dietary fiber (DF) as well as antioxidants and can be effectively transformed into functional DF powder. In the past, however, only hot air drying was used to prepare DF powder from cabbage outer leaves although it is well recognized that this drying technique could lead to much quality degradation of a dried product. This work was therefore aimed at studying the evolution of selected important antioxidants, e.g., phenolic compounds and vitamin C, in white cabbage outer leaves during vacuum drying at 60, 70 and 80 degrees C. The effect of pretreatment viz. steam blanching was also evaluated. The results showed that there were losses of antioxidants during steam blanching; vacuum dried blanched leaves nevertheless contained higher antioxidant contents and activity than dried unblanched leaves. Losses of antioxidants during vacuum drying were also noted to be less than those during hot air drying. Overall, the results showed that there were no differences in the antioxidants retention among all the tested conditions performed in this study. Therefore, the most suitable condition for the production of antioxidant DF powder from cabbage outer leaves is vacuum drying at 80 degrees C as this condition requires the minimum specific energy consumption.},

   abstract = {To reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses resulting from fecal contamination in produce fields, a hyperspectral, line-scan, laser-induced fluorescence imaging system was developed with the goal of eventually incorporating the imaging system into a pre-harvest detection apparatus for fecal contamination. The imaging system includes an intensified, gated camera, a spectral adapter, a 355 nm pulsed laser, and laser expansion optics that produce a line-illumination profile. To validate and test the system, spinach leaves inoculated with dilutions of bovine fecal material were imaged repeatedly using a predefined set of imaging parameters. These images were used to evaluate methods for detecting fecal contamination. Methods investigated included ratio, edge, threshold, and slope detection. Differences in the magnitude of averaged intensities for the spectral range of 450-500 nm for regions within fecal contamination sites and in nearby uncontaminated surface areas suggested that the 450-500 nm waveband would be a good region for use in detection tests. Validation tests that used threshold or slope detection, the 450-500 nm waveband, and that took advantage of the slower fluorescence decay rates of fecal contamination sites relative to uncontaminated surface areas showed almost 100% detection of 1:2, 1:10, and 1:100 dilution sites and over 70% detection of 1:200 dilution sites with essentially zero false positives. These results suggest that the imaging system has potential for development of a commercially viable apparatus for pre-harvest detection of fecal contamination in produce fields and for detection of fecal contamination of leafy green vegetables in general. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether the timing or mode of application influences the antimicrobial efficacy of a sodium hypochlorite solution against microorganisms on fresh-cut Romaine lettuce. Lettuce leaves were treated with a solution of sodium hypochlorite containing 70 mg liter -1 free chlorine prior to slicing (WLS), while submerged in the solution (CWS), or after slicing (PCS), the last being common practice in the fresh-cut industry. Immediate antimicrobial effects were determined from analyses performed directly after treatment, while delayed effects were derived from analysis of packaged samples stored at 4 and 15°C. Experiments were performed with both uninoculated and inoculated whole leaves, using Escherichia coli O157:H7 from a type collection as an inoculum. The CWS treatment provided the greatest initial reductions in aerobic plate counts of E. coli O157:H7 populations, followed by PCS and WLS. The advantage afforded by the CWS approach was maintained over 10 days in storage at 4°C. In addition, it was noted that the visual quality attributes of the fresh-cut lettuce from the CWS approach were better than those from the other two treatments. These results collectively suggest that slicing lettuce under a sanitizer solution could provide better disinfection of fresh-cut Romaine lettuce than the current practice of washing with sanitizer after cutting has taken place.

In this study we evaluated the soil covers applied preceding planting and its effects on some agronomic characteristics and productivity of cauliflower and cabbage. We used a factorial randomized blocks design, with four soil covers (sunnhemp, brachiaria, millet and fallow) and two crops (cauliflower and cabbage) with four replications in plots of 20 m(2) (4x5 m). We determined the number of leaves, height, head and stem diameter, and fresh and dry mass. Mulches influenced positively the agronomic characteristics of cauliflower and cabbage for head diameter (55.1 and 194.8 cm), stem diameter (70.4 and 49.2 mm) and horizontal diameter (169.9 and 14 8 mm), fresh mass (1.0 to 2.8 kg) and dry mass of the head (73.4 and 0.65 g) and productivity (7.3 to 19.2 t/ha) of the crops, respectively, when grown on brachiaria waste. The marketable fresh mass of cabbage (2.8 kg) was higher than the standard required by the Brazilian consumer market.},

We analyzed 50 cress samples using the wash and centrifugation technique and the sedimentation method. Among the samples, 6 presented trophozoites of Balantidium coli, cyst of Entamoeba coli and parasites of Stronylidae and Trichuridae Family and 14 samples were contaminated with maggots, slugs and snails. Factors related to this parasitological contamination may be the failure in the quality of water used for irrigation, and the planting, storage and the distribution of the plants. As these vegetables are mainly eaten in natura, we recommend the inclusion of safety procedures along the entire process to protect the health of consumers, since vegetables can be a zoonosis transmitter vehicle.},

   abstract = {The goal of this study is to model the effects of reusing salad from salad bars to reduce product loss, while keeping microbial safety and product quality at acceptable levels. We, therefore, expand our previously developed simulation model by incorporating reuse strategies and a quality decay model. The expanded model is used to simulate different salad reuse scenarios and to quantify the consequences to product loss, microbial safety and product quality. With this study, we show an application of a generic approach for the integrated modelling of product loss, microbial safety and product quality. The most cautious scenario consists of reusing salad for only 1 day after the first use and only if the salad originates from a package with a valid best-before date at the time of reuse (minimum reuse of salad with the best-before date criterion). This scenario decreases product loss at the salad bar considerably from 37% to 29% (-21%). This considerable benefit occurs almost without causing product loss at the cold storage (increase from 0% to 1%), with only a minimal increase in the number of foetal mortality cases because of Listeria monocytogenes (increase from 11.9 to 12.2 cases per year (+3%)) and hardly any decline in product quality.},

A combination of the most probable number - polymerase chain reaction (MPNPCR) method was applied to detect the presence of V. parahaemolyticus and to enumerate their density in the food samples. The study analyzed 276 samples of common vegetables eaten raw in Malaysia (Wild cosmos=8; Japanese parsley=21; Cabbage=30; Lettuce=16; Indian pennywort=17; Carrot=31; Sweet potato=29; Tomato=38; Cucumber=28; Four-winged bean=26; Long bean=32). The samples were purchased from two supermarkets (A and B) and two wet markets (C and D). The occurrence of V. parahaemolyticus detected was 20.65%, with a higher frequency of V. parahaemolyticus in vegetables obtained from wet markets (Wet market C=27.27%; Wet Market D=32.05%) compared with supermarkets (Supermarket A=1.64%; Supermarket B=16.67%). V. parahaemolyticus was most prevalent in Indian pennywort (41.18%). The density of V. parahaemolyticus in all the samples ranged from <3 up to >2,400 MPN/g, mostly <3 MPN/g concentration. Raw vegetables from wet markets contained higher levels of V. parahaemolyticus compared with supermarkets. Although V. parahaemolyticus was present in raw vegetables, its numbers were low. The results suggest that raw vegetables act as a transmission route for V. parahaemolyticus. This study will be the first biosafety assessment of V. parahaemolyticus in raw vegetables in Malaysia. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the changes on chemical and microbiological characteristics of a Red Latosol dystrophic soil after the cultivation of lettuce irrigated with treated wastewater. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the Center of Agricultural Science of UFSCar, in Araras/SP/Brazil. Lettuce seedlings were irrigated by drip using treated wastewater and potable water with 4 replications for each one. After the maturation, the plants were collected along with soil samples. The physical and chemical properties and heterotrophic microorganism and conforms were analyzed. The parameters sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), BOD, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, nitrate, chlorine, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and conforms were analyzed on the irrigation water. The values of exchangeable sodium percentage and SAR on the plots irrigated with treated wastewater indicated soil salinization. The EC kept the value according to the standard for irrigation water in both treatments. It was observed an increase on soil of some nutrients (K, Ca, H, Al, S) after the cultivation. It was not observed presence of Escherichia coli on lettuce leaves and soil. The total conforms at lettuces presented a risk of contamination for human health due the possible contamination. The treated wastewater did not cause damages on physical properties of soil and promoted increase of nutrients on soil.},

   abstract = {Fresh produce has been recognized as a vehicle for transmission of protozoan parasites for many years, and there are numerous publications regarding their occurrence on such foodstuffs, indicating their potential importance as foodborne parasites. Nevertheless, few studies have been published regarding the effectiveness of this transmission route, and whether contamination is likely to result in transmission. The purpose of this study was to assess the viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, two protozoa associated with both waterborne and foodborne transmission, by spiking fresh produce (lettuce leaves) with viable transmission stages and determining changes in viability. These investigations were performed under different conditions and over time spans that may be used in a regular household; a fridge at 4 °C, under ambient temperatures exposed to natural cycles of light during night and day, and inside a cupboard to ensure no light exposure, for a duration of up to two weeks, or as long as the produce remained visually palatable. The major finding from this study is that whereas both Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts survive well when kept moist and refrigerated, survival of Giardia cysts was abrogated on lettuce at room temperature. Indeed, almost 50% die-off of Giardia cysts was recorded within the first 24 h. Cryptosporidium oocysts had a stable viability throughout the experiment under all the conditions investigated, indicating that fresh produce is a suitable transmission vehicle for Cryptosporidium, even if contamination occurs on-farm and the parasites are exposed to non-favourable storage conditions, as may be common in developing countries. Giardia cysts were not as robust as Cryptosporidium oocysts, and would be probably unlikely to survive under ambient storage conditions on-farm, during sale, or at home. However, if kept refrigerated, then some contaminating Giardia cysts may remain viable and therefore may pose a threat to the consumer. Thus, as the cold chain for transport and storage of fresh produce improves, it is important that similar improvements are implemented to reduce the contamination of fresh produce with parasite transmission stages. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Consuming raw food like lettuce may carry protozoa cysts and helminth eggs, causing parasitic infections. Therefore, the parasitological analysis of this type of food it’s important for public health because it provides data on the hygiene conditions in which these vegetables were produced, transported, processed and handled until the ingestion. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of parasitic structures in samples of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) sold in self-service restaurants in São Miguel do Oeste, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The samples were randomly collected in 20 locations in duplicate, prepared according to the method of Hoffman, Pons, and Janer (1934) and analyzed with an optical light microscopy. The parasitic structures found were Cysts Balantidium coli, Giardia spp. and Entamoeba spp. Ascaris lumbricoides eggs and grubs of Strongyloides stercoralis. These results demonstrate that the lettuce served at most self-service restaurants evaluated is unfit for intake and indicates the need to implement hygienic and educational measures to minimize contamination and ensure the safety of the ingestion of this vegetable. © 2018, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

   abstract = {Cabbage (Brassicaceae) is one of the most frequently consumed exotic vegetables in Benin and also the most affected by insects. To meet growing food demand, farmers rely heavily on synthetic pesticides that are harmful for themselves, consumers and the environment. Integrated pest management has been proposed as the means to improve vegetable productivity and quality in many developing countries. One approach is to substitute pesticides with physical barriers to insects, like nets. Here, we assess consumers' perceptions about cabbage and their purchasing behavior towards cabbage that was produced using these nets in two major cities in Benin. Results indicate that consumers are aware of the health risks associated with intensive use of pesticides but were not able to recognize the quality difference between cabbage produced under nets from those using pesticides. All consumers were willing to pay a price premium for cabbage with minimized pesticides residues compared with conventionally produced cabbage, the average premium being 38%. Women, older, highly educated consumers and those able to distinguish cabbage qualities were willing to pay the most. We suggest that farmers will obtain higher prices if their production of cabbage with preferred characteristics is accompanied by an improved marketing strategy.},

   abstract = {Viral foodborne outbreaks are a serious threat to public health, and fresh produce is becoming increasingly recognized as a transmission vehicle. To limit foodborne disease, ready-to-eat leafy greens are typically washed with a chlorine-based sanitizer during commercial production. This study assessed the efficacy of a chlorine-based sanitizer against coliphage MS2, as a potential surrogate for foodborne viruses, on fresh-cut romaine lettuce during simulated commercial production using a smallscale processing line. Before processing, romaine lettuce was inoculated to contain approximately 105 and 106 PFU/g of MS2 for experiments with and without sanitizer, respectively. Lettuce samples were collected following each stage of processing, which included mechanical shredding, 2 min of flume washing (with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine), shaker table dewatering, and centrifugal drying. In addition, the spent centrifuge water and flume wash water were collected, with the flume water concentrated using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration. MS2 was recovered from lettuce in Tris-glycine buffer and quantified as PFUs in a double-agar overlay assay. The greatest reduction in MS2 occurred between shredding and flume washing, with levels remaining relatively stable following flume washing with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine. Average total reductions of 0.8 and 1.0 log PFU/g were seen after processing with and without the sanitizer, respectively, with no statistical difference observed between the two treatments (P > 0.05). The average MS2 level in the spent centrifugation water started at 4.0 log PFU/ml for experiments with sanitizer and the average MS2 reduction in the flume wash water was 4 log (PFU) for experiments with sanitizer, demonstrating that removals could be achieved in the water itself. These findings suggest that the currently recommended commercial production practices are unable to effectively decrease viruses once they have attached to leafy greens during commercial processing. © 2017 International Association for Food Protection.},

For this purpose, fresh-cut radicchio cv. Rosso di Chioggia was produced on pilot-plant scale applying five different processing lines. Throughout storage (4 °C, up to 12 days), O2 and CO2 levels in the modified atmosphere of the consumer-sized sample bags were monitored, as well as phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities, levels of anthocyanins and bitter sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). Furthermore, bacterial viable counts of fresh-cut products and process waters, and the chemical oxygen demand of the process waters were assessed. Throughout storage, water jet cutting did not alter the physiological condition nor the microbiological quality of the fresh-cut produce compared to blade cutting using a newly sharpened blade. Moreover, leaching of SLs through washing was comparable in blade and water jet cut samples. Thus, a similar degree of tissue wounding due to both cutting techniques applied may be assumed. Washing radicchio prior to shredding resulted in reduced leaching of SLs and a lower degree of microbial and organic contamination of the process water. However, compared to conventional washing, pre-washing was slightly less effective in reducing microbial counts on the produce. While levels of anthocyanins remained constant throughout storage, unaffected by different processing, SL profiles substantially changed in samples of all processing lines. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Throughout refrigerated storage (4 °C, 12 days), O<inf>2</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> levels in the modified atmosphere of the consumer-sized sample bags were monitored, and fresh-cut products and process water were subjected to microbiological analysis. As further quality parameters, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity as well as levels of chlorophyll a and b, β-carotene and cyanidin 3-O-(6”-O-malonyl)-glucoside were determined by HPLC with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and HPLC coupled with diode array detection and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MSn) throughout storage. Additionally, visual appearance and cut edge browning were assessed by sensorial evaluation and stereo microscopy on storage day 8. Microbiological quality throughout commercial shelf life was best retained by warm water washing of shredded lettuce. Furthermore, moderate heat treatment significantly reduced PAL activity and cut edge browning without affecting pigment contents and vitality of the lettuce tissue. Additionally, warm water treatment significantly lowered the microbial load in the process water. Throughout storage, water jet cutting did not affect the microbial, physiological and sensorial fresh-cut lettuce quality compared to blade cutting using a newly sharpened blade, thus indicating a similar degree of wounding due to the cutting techniques applied. The application of a pre-washing step prior to shredding was found to be suitable to reduce the risk of cross-contamination in subsequent process steps. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This system can test the Raman spectroscopy of the whole spinach including the automatic collection, display and storage of the Raman signal of all the scanned points by set up different scan step. A new method to remove the Raman spectrum background was proposed based on data replacement with linear equation at the range of threshold spectrum on both sides of the effective peaks according to the characteristics of spinach original spectra. Its principle is to determine the starting position of linear fitting by judging whether there is trough on both sides of the crest, and then to generate and replace the original spectra data in peak position through the linear fitting equation. Spinach samples were used for the experiment showed that the chlorophyll content and distribution of chlorpyrifos pesticide residue on each scanning point can be obtained after scanning. Therefore, the point scanning Raman system could improve detection accuracy of the quality and safety parameters for the non-uniform samples effectively. © 2016, Peking University Press.

In this work the transfer of difenoconazole and azoxystrobin residues from chrysanthemum tea to its infusion was investigated at different water temperatures, infusion intervals and times. The transfer percentages were in the range of 18.7-51.6% for difenoconazole and of 38.1-71.2% for azoxystrobin, and increased considerably with longer infusion intervals. The results indicated that azoxystrobin with a lower octanol-water partition coefficient of 2.5, showed a higher transfer than that of difenoconazole with a relatively high octanol-water partition coefficient of 4.4. Water temperature had no significant effect on the transfer of the two residues, and no obvious loss of difenoconazole and azoxystrobin occurred during the infusion process. The concentrations in the infusions decreased gradually from 0.67 to 0.30 μg kg-1 for difenoconazole and from 2.3 to 0.46 μg kg-1 for azoxystrobin after five infusions. To assess the potential health risk, the values of estimate expose risk were calculated to be 0.016 for difenoconazole and 0.0022 for azoxystrobin, meaning the daily residue intake of the two analytes from chrysanthemum tea was safe. This research may help assure food safety and identify the potential exposure risks from pesticides in chrysanthemum that may be health concerns. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

   abstract = {This paper reported the development of hyperspectral fluorescence imaging system using ultraviolet-A excitation (320-400 nm) for detection of bovine fecal contaminants on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of romaine lettuce and baby spinach leaves. Six spots of fecal contamination were applied to each of 40 lettuce and 40 spinach leaves. In this study, the wavebands at 666 nm and 680 nm were selected by the correlation analysis. The two-band ratio, 666 nm / 680 nm, of fluorescence intensity was used to differentiate the contaminated spots from uncontaminated leaf area. The proposed method could accurately detect all of the contaminated spots. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

   abstract = {This paper reports the development of a multispectral algorithm, using the line-scan hyperspectral imaging system, to detect fecal contamination on leafy greens. Fresh bovine feces were applied to the surfaces of washed loose baby spinach leaves. A hyperspectral line-scan imaging system was used to acquire hyperspectral fluorescence images of the contaminated leaves. Hyperspectral image analysis resulted in the selection of the 666 nm and 688 nm wavebands for a multispectral algorithm to rapidly detect feces on leafy greens, by use of the ratio of fluorescence intensities measured at those two wavebands (666 nm over 688 nm). The algorithm successfully distinguished most of the lowly diluted fecal spots (0.05 g feces/ml water and 0.025 g feces/ml water) and some of the highly diluted spots (0.0125 g feces/ml water and 0.00625 g feces/ml water) from the clean spinach leaves. The results showed the potential of the multispectral algorithm with line-scan imaging system for application to automated food processing lines for food safety inspection of leafy green vegetables. © 2013 SPIE.},

   abstract = {Kale (Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family, and kale leaves have large amounts of dietary fiber and polyphenolics. Dietary fiber can bind bile acids, thus potentially decreasing cholesterol levels; however, whether the polyphenols from kale contribute to in vitro bile acid binding capacity remains unclear. In the present study, kale was extracted with hexane, acetone, and MeOH:water and the dried extracts, as well as the fiber-rich residue, were tested for their bile acid binding capacity. The fiber-rich residue bound total bile acids in amounts equivalent to that bound by raw kale. The lyophilized acetone extract bound significantly more glycochenodeoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate and less of other bile acids. To test whether bile acid binding enhanced the bioaccessibility of polyphenolic compounds from kale, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify chemical constituents and measure their bioaccessibility in an in vitro digestion reaction. This identified 36 phenolic compounds in kale, including 18 kaempferol derivatives, 13 quercetin derivatives, 4 sinapoyl derivatives, and one caffeoylquinic acid. The bioaccessibility of these phenolics was significantly higher (69.4%) in digestions with bile acids. Moreover, bile acids enhanced the bioaccessibility of quercetin by 25 times: only 2.7% of quercetin derivatives were bioaccessible in the digestion without bile acids, but with bile acids, their accessibility increased to 69.5%. Bile acids increased the bioaccessibility of kaempferol from 37.7% to 69.2%. The extractability and biostability of total phenolics in the digested residue increased 1.8 fold in the digestions with bile acids. These results demonstrated the potential use of kale to improve human health. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Vegetable cultivation in soils polluted with heavy metals, antibiotics and a high abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) can seriously threaten human health through the food chain. Therefore, novel techniques that not only remediate soil, but also ensure food security are urgently required. In the present study, two successive washings with 20gL-1 of sophoroliplid solution plus ultrasonication (35kHz) were effective in extracting 71.2% Cd, 88.2% tetracycline, 96.6% sulfadiazine, and 100% roxithromycin. Simultaneously, relative abundance of ARGs (tetM, tetX, sulI, and sulII) was decreased to 10-7-10-8 (ARG copies/16S copies). Further, lettuce cultivation in the 2nd washed soil showed significant improvement in vegetable growth indices (fresh/dry weight, root surface area, chlorophyll content and soluble protein content) and a decrease in isolate counts for antibiotic-resistant bacterial endophytes and ARG abundance in lettuce tissues. This combined cleanup strategy provides an environmentally friendly technology for ensuring vegetable security in washed soils. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

Assessing effects of such exposures on honeybees is an essential part of the risk assessment process for transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cabbage. Feeding trials were conducted in a laboratory setting to test for possible effects of Cry1Ba3 cabbage pollen on Italian-derived honeybees Apis mellifera L. Newly emerged A. mellifera were fed transgenic pollen, activated Cry1Ba3 toxin, pure sugar syrup (60% w/v sucrose solution), and non-transgenic cabbage pollen, respectively. Then the effects on survival, pollen consumption, weight, detoxification enzyme activity and midgut enzyme activity of A. mellifera were monitored. The results showed that there were no significant differences in survival, pollen consumption, weight, detoxification enzyme activity among all treatments. No significant differences in the activities of total proteolytic enzyme, active alkaline trypsin-like enzyme and weak alkaline trypsin-like enzyme were observed among all treatments. These results indicate that the side-effects of the Cry1Ba3 cabbage pollen on A. mellifera L. are unlikely. © 2017 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {A modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method was established for simultaneous extraction and cleanup of multiple antibiotics in leafy vegetables, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used for analysis. Antibiotics in leafy vegetables were extracted with citric acid/sodium citrate in mixed solvents consisting of acetonitrile/methanol (85:15, v/v) from 10 g of vegetables. Octadecylsilyl and graphitized carbon black were used as dispersant adsorbents. This method was able to effectively extract all of the target antibiotics from leafy vegetables. The average recoveries of 20 antibiotics ranged from 57 to 91%. The limits of detection were 0.33–2.92 μg/kg. The developed method subsequently demonstrated its selectivity, sensitivity, and reliability for detecting multiple antibiotics in 15 samples. Antibiotic residues in vegetables have attracted great concern with respect to human health. It is recommended that standards should be established for antibiotic residues in vegetables to ensure food safety. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

   abstract = {A fluorescence sensing material based on quantum dots with excellent optical properties and molecularly imprinted polymer (QDs@MIP) with specific recognition has been developed. First the surface of CdSe/ZnS QDs was modified with ionic liquids (ILs) by electrostatic interaction. The fluorescence sensing material was constructed from anchoring the MIP layer on IL modified CdSe/ZnS QDs by copolymerization, which had been developed for the detection of carbaryl in rice and Chinese cabbage. The MIP fluorescence was more strongly quenched by carbaryl than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP) fluorescence, which indicated that the QDs@MIP could selectively recognize the corresponding carbaryl. Furthermore, the developed QDs@MIP method was validated by HPLC and ELISA respectively, and the results of these methods were well correlated (R2 = 0.98). The fluorescence sensing material had obvious advantages, such as being easily prepared and having specific recognition and photostability. The developed method was simple and effective for the detection of carbaryl. And, it could also provide the technical support for the rapid detection in food safety fields. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Heavy metal pollution of water is of concern for human health and ecosystem. Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},
