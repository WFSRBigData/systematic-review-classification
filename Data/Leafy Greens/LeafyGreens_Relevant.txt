   abstract = {The use of contaminated land or irrigation water for agriculture in the neighborhood of mines as well as the transfer of metals from soils to vegetables and to humans through the food chain is a worldwide concern. This study was conducted to compare the effects on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. varieties Marady and Romana) grown in different seasons (autumn and summer) when exposed to high and low uranium concentrations, both in irrigation water and soils (total and available fraction), near a former uranium mine. Irrigation with uranium contaminated water (0.94 to 1.14. mg/L) together with high concentrations of uranium in the soil available fraction (9.2 to 14.5. mg/kg) had negative effects on both lettuce varieties, namely on leaf yield reduction (up to 53% and 87% in autumn and summer experiments, respectively) and increase of uranium concentration in the leaves (up to 2.13 and 5.37. mg/kg. dry. weight) and in the roots (up to 4.64 and 28.2. mg/kg. dry. weight) for Marady and Romana varieties, respectively. The effect on lettuce yield was mainly due to the soil salinity (electrical conductivity up to 6.31. mS/cm) as a consequence of water irrigation with high electrical conductivity (1.67 to 1.82. mS/cm) and low tolerance of lettuce to the soil salinity. The highest concentration of uranium in the Romana variety was also the result of its growth in a dry season when the frequency and amount of water irrigation was great. The consumption of uranium by an adult, teenager and child, from lettuce that concentrate more this element (234. μg. U/kg fresh weight) was, respectively, 16.7, 17.7 and 24.4% of the tolerable daily limit intake set by the World Health Organization (0.6. mg. U/kg body weight daily; WHO, 2005). These values suggest that lettuce had low impact on human uranium intake and should not present a concern for Cunha Baixa inhabitant's health assuming that this vegetable is the only food consumed with high uranium concentrations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Since the inception of global industrialization, the growth of steroid estrogens becomes a matter of emerging serious concern for the rapid population. Steroidal estrogens are potent endocrine-upsetting chemicals that are excreted naturally by vertebrates (e.g., humans and fish) and can enter natural waters through the discharge of treated and raw sewage. Steroidal estrogens in plants may enter the food web and become a serious threat to human health. We evaluated the uptake and accumulation of ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17-estradiol (17-E2) in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) grown under controlled environmental condition over 21days growth period. An effective analytical method based on ultrasonic liquid extraction (ULE) for solid samples and solid phase extraction (SPE) for liquid samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been developed to determine the steroid estrogens in lettuce plants. The extent of uptake and accumulation was observed in a dose-dependent manner and roots were major organs for estrogen deposition. Unlike the 17-E2, EE2 was less accumulated and translocated from root to leaves. For 17-E2, the distribution in lettuce was primarily to roots after the second week (13%), whereas in leaves it was (10%) over the entire study period. The distribution of EE2 at 2000gL(-1) in roots and leaves was very low (3.07% and 0.54%) during the first week and then was highest (12% in roots and 8% in leaves) in last week. Bioaccumulation factor values of 17-E2 and EE2 in roots were 0.33 and 0.29 at 50gL(-1) concentration as maximum values were found at 50gL(-1) rather than 500 and 2000 in all observed plant tissues. Similar trend was noticed in roots than leaves for bioconcentration factor as the highest bioconcentration values were observed at 50gL(-1) concentration instead of 500 and 2000gL(-1) spiked concentration. These findings mainly indicate the potential for uptake and bioaccumulation of estrogens in lettuce plants. Overall, the estrogen contents in lettuce were compared to the FAO/WHO recommended toxic level and were found to be higher than the toxic level which is of serious concern to the public health. This analytical procedure may aid in future studies on risks associated with uptake of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in lettuce plants.},

Three types of vegetable seedlings, including cucumber (Cucumis sativus), cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa), were also cultivated during 45 d in the greenhouse. All antibiotics taken up by tested plants showed negative effects on growth. Relatively high levels of tetracyclines and sulfonamides (SAs) were detected in the nonedible parts, roots, and leaves of cucumber and tomato, but fruit parts accumulated them lower than acceptable daily intake. Indeed, cucumber roots accumulated SAs by up to 94.6% of total addition (at 5 mg kg-1 soil). © 2014 american chemical society.},

   abstract = {The effect of clay soil contamination time on the transfer factors (Fvs) of 137Cs and 90Sr was investigated in four different growth stages of winter wheat and lettuce crops. The experiment was performed in an open field using lysimeters. The Fvs were the ratio of the activity concentrations of the radionuclides in crops to those in soil, both as dry weight (Bq kg-1). Significant difference of log-Fvs was evaluated using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Basically, Fvs of 90Sr were higher than those of 137Cs, despite of the application stage or crop' variety. Higher Fvs for both radionuclides were observed for lettuce in comparison to winter wheat. Fvs of 90Sr showed comparable trends for both crops with enhanced Fvs obtained when contamination occurred in early stages, i.e. 1.20 for lettuce and 0.88 and 0.02 for winter wheat, straw and grains, respectively. Despite the fluctuation noted in the pattern of Fvs for 137Cs, soil contaminated at the second stage gave the highest Fvs for lettuce and grains, with geometric means of 0.21 and 0.01, respectively. However, wheat-straw showed remarkable increase in Fv for the latest contamination (ripening stage), about 0.06. It could be concluded that soil contamination at early growth stages would represent high radiological risk for the scenarios studied with an exception to 137Cs in winter wheat-straw which reflected greater hazard at the latest application. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A multiresidue method has been developed for the determination of emerging pollutants in leafy and root vegetables. Selected compounds were 6 perfluoroalkyl compounds (5 perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), 3 non-ionic surfactants (nonylphenol and nonylphenolethoxylates), 8 anionic surfactants (4 alkylsulfates and 4 linear alkylbenzene sulfonates), 4 preservatives (parabens), 2 biocides (triclosan and triclocarban), 2 plasticizers (bisphenol A and di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate), 6 UV-filters (benzophenones) and 4 hormones. The method is based on ultrasound-assisted extraction, clean-up by dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Due to the diversity of the physico-chemical properties of the target compounds, and to better evaluate the influence of sample treatment variables in extraction efficiencies, Box-Behnken design was applied to optimize extraction solvent volume, number of extraction cycles and d-SPE sorbent amount. Linearity (R-2) higher than 0.992, accuracy (expressed as relative recoveries) in the range from 81 to 126%, precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) lower than 19% and limits of detection between 0.025 and 12.5 ng g(-1) dry weight were achieved. The method was applied to leafy vegetables (lettuce, spinach and chard) and root vegetables (carrot, turnip and potato) from a local market. The highest concentrations corresponded to the surfactants reaching levels up to 114 ng g(-1) (dry weight), in one of the lettuce samples analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Agricultural intensification has increased crop productivity but decreased agroecosystem services. Agricultural intensification is occurring notably for horticultural crops such as lettuce. In conventional agriculture, lettuce protection is achieved mostly by preventive applications of pesticides with about eight treatments for a 60-90-day-long cycle in the Mediterranean region. However, new sustainable control strategies are needed due to pesticide impact on environment and human health, emerging pesticide resistance, and stricter policies on levels of pesticide residues in food. Here, we review knowledge and methods allowing to grow lettuce with less pesticides. Advances shown are based on pest ecology and pathogen control by the agroecosystem. The major points are as follows: (1) pest and pathogen community composition depends partly on climatic conditions. The identification of pests and pathogens that can threaten the crop is the first step to design innovative lettuce cropping systems less dependent on pesticides. (2) The numerous alternative techniques currently available should be combined to control lettuce pests and pathogens. The effects of alternative techniques on non-target organisms including non-target pests are poorly known so far. (3) Designing sustainable systems requires taking into account ecological interactions and suitability of different management techniques of low impact. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

   abstract = {Understanding the uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals in vegetables under typical irrigation practices is critical to risk assessment of crop irrigation with reclaimed water. This study investigated the pharmaceutical residues in greenhouse lettuce under overhead and soil-surface irrigations using pharmaceutical-contaminated water. Compared to soil-surface irrigation, overhead irrigation substantially increased the pharmaceutical residues in lettuce shoots. The increased residue levels persisted even after washing for trimethoprim, monensin sodium, and tylosin, indicating their strong sorption to the shoots. The postwashing concentrations in fresh shoots varied from 0.05 ± 0.04 μg/kg for sulfadiazine to 345 ± 139 μg/kg for carbamazepine. Root concentration factors ranged from 0.04 ± 0.14 for tylosin to 19.2 ± 15.7 for sulfamethoxazole. Translocation factors in surface-irrigated lettuce were low for sulfamethoxalzole, trimethoprim, monensin sodium, and tylosin (0.07-0.15), but high for caffeine (4.28 ± 3.01) and carbamazepine (8.15 ± 2.87). Carbamazepine was persistent in soil and hyperaccumulated in shoots. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Veterinary antibiotics like sulfonamides are frequently detected in arable lands and they can potentially contaminate food crops. It is thus of great importance to identify strategies to reduce food crops' uptake of antibiotics. For the first time, using a pot culture experiment, sulfathiazole (STZ) uptake by lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in antibiotic-contaminated soils (10 and 100 mg STZ kg(-1) soil) and treated with (in) organic amendments, namely chemical fertilizer (NPK), compost, and hairy vetch, was investigated. Subsequent enhanced plant growth was witnessed when using hairy vetch treatment. The amount of antibiotic uptake was significantly reduced to 5 and 33% with hairy vetch application compared to compost or NPK application at 10 and 100 mg kg-1 STZ, respectively. The total amounts of accumulated STZ in plant parts increased as the levels of STZ contaminated in soils were increased. STZ was much more abundant in the roots than the leaves. Within 30 days, the extractable STZ in the treated soils-especially with hairy vetch-diminished considerably to concentrations that are frequently detected in arable soils. We conclude that utilization of green manure (cover crop-hairy vetch) is a viable strategy for safer crop production in antibiotic-contaminated soils.},

   abstract = {The aim of this research is to establish the processing factors of six pesticides durong the preparation of fresh-cut lettuce and to assess the risk of ingestion of pesticide residues associated with the consumption of the same. A field study was carried out on the dissipation of three insecticides (imidacloprid, tebufenozide, cypermethrin) and three fungicides (metalaxyl, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin) during treatment conditions simulating those used for commercial fresh-cut lettuce. A simultaneous residue analysis method is validated using QuEChERS extraction with acetonitrile and CG-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis. The residues detected after field application never exceed the established Maximum Residue Limits. The processing factors were generally less than 1 (between 0.34 for tebufenozide and 0.53 for imidacloprid), indicating that the process, as a whole, considerably reduces residue levels in processed lettuce compared to fresh lettuce. It is confirmed that cutting, followed by washing and drying, considerably reduces the residues. A matrix effect in the dialyzation of the pesticides is observed and the in vitro study of bioavailability establishes a low percentage of stomach absorption capacity (<15%). The EDI/ADI ratios found in all cases were well below their ADI values, and the dietary exposure assessed (EDI) in fresh-cut lettuce showed no concerns for consumer health. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of the most toxic and common microcystins (MCs) variant found in aquatic ecosystems. Little is known about the possibility of recovering microcystins contaminated agricultural crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the bioaccumulation and depuration kinetics of MC-LR in leaf tissues of lettuce and arugula, and estimate the total daily intake (ToDI) of MC-LR via contaminated vegetables by humans. Arugula and lettuce were irrigated with contaminated water having 5 and 10 μg L− 1 of MC-LR for 7 days (bioaccumulation), and subsequently, with uncontaminated water for 7 days (depuration). Quantification of MC-LR was performed by LC-MS/MS. The one-compartment biokinetic model was employed for MC-LR bioaccumulation and depuration data analysis. MC-LR was only accumulated in lettuce. After 7 days of irrigation with uncontaminated water, over 25% of accumulated MC-LR was still retained in leaf tissues of plants treated with 10 μg L− 1 MC-LR. Total daily toxin intake by adult consumers (60 kg-bw) exceeded the 0.04 μg MC-LR kg− 1 limit recommended by WHO. Bioaccumulation was found to be linearly proportional to the exposure concentration of the toxin, increasing over time; and estimated to become saturated after 30 days of uninterrupted exposure. On the other hand, MC-LR depuration was less efficient at higher exposure concentrations. This is because biokinetic half-life calculations gave 2.9 and 3.7 days for 5 and 10 μg L− 1 MC-LR treatments, which means 29–37 days are required to eliminate the toxin. For the first time, our results demonstrated the possibility of MC-LR decontamination of lettuce plants. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) has become a globally important secondary metabolite due to the negative effect it has on human and animal health. As a means of evaluating the risk of human exposure to CYN, the bioaccumulation and depuration of the toxin in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and arugula (Eruca sativa Mill.) were investigated, after irrigation with contaminated water. The vegetables were irrigated for 7 days with CYN (3, 5 and 10 μg/L) contaminated water (bioaccumulation phase), and subsequently, irrigated for 7 days with uncontaminated distilled water (depuration phase). In general, the bioaccumulation of CYN in both vegetables decreased with increasing exposure concentration. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of CYN increased with the progression of the experiment at 3.0 μg/L CYN, while the reverse occurred at 5 and 10 μg/L CYN. In arugula, BCF increased at all CYN exposure concentrations throughout the study. The depuration of CYN decreased with increasing exposure concentration but was highest in the plants of both species with the highest bioaccumulation of CYN. Specifically, in plants previously irrigated with water contaminated with 3, 5 and 10 μg/L CYN, the depuration of the toxin was 60.68, 27.67 and 18.52% for lettuce, and 47, 46.21 and 27.67% for arugula, respectively. Human health risks assessment revealed that the consumption of approximately 10 to 40 g of vegetables per meal will expose children and adults to 1.00-6.00 ng CYN/kg body mass for lettuce and 2.22-7.70 ng CYN/kg body mass for arugula. The irrigation of lettuce and arugula with contaminated water containing low CYN concentrations constitutes a potential human exposure route. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Vegetables can contain significant amounts of nitrate and, therefore, may pose health hazards to consumers by exceeding the accepted daily intake for nitrate. Different hydroponic growing patterns were examined in this work in order to obtain ‘nitrate-free lettuces’. Growing lettuces on low nitrate content nutrient solution resulted in a significant decrease in lettuces’ nitrate concentrations (1741 versus 39 mg kg−1), however the beneficial effect was cancelled out by an increase in the ambient temperature. Nitrate replacement with ammonium was associated with an important decrease of the lettuces’ nitrate concentration (from 1896 to 14 mg kg−1) and survival rate. An economically feasible method to reduce nitrate concentrations was the removal of all inorganic nitrogen from the nutrient solution before the exponential growth phase. This method led to lettuces almost devoid of nitrate (10 mg kg−1). The dried mass and calcinated mass of lettuces, used as markers of lettuces’ quality, were not influenced by this treatment, but a small reduction (18%, p &lt; 0.05) in the fresh mass was recorded. The concentrations of nitrite in the lettuces and their modifications are also discussed in the paper. It is possible to obtain ‘nitrate-free’ lettuces in an economically feasible way. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (HMs) are predominant pollutants normally coexisting at electronic waste dumping sites or in agricultural soils irrigated with wastewater. The accumulation of PAHs and HMs in food crops has become a major concern for food security. This study explored the hydroponic uptake of 16 priority PAHs and 5 HMs (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) by pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.). PAHs exhibited stronger inhibition on pak choi growth and physiological features than HMs. Five HMs were categorized into high-impact HMs (Cr, Cu, and Pb) and low-impact HMs (Cd and Zn) with distinct behavior under the coexposure with PAHs, and low-impact HMs showed synergistic toxicity effects with PAHs. Coexposure to PAHs and HMs slightly decreased the uptake and translocation of PAHs by pak choi, possibly attributing to the commutative hindering effects on root adsorption or cation-pi interactions. The bioconcentration factors in PAHs + HMs treatments were independent of the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow), owing to the cation-pi interaction associated change of K-ow and induced defective root system. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms and influential factors of PAHs uptake in Brassica chinensis L. and gives clues for reassessing the environmental risks of PAHs in food crops.},

   abstract = {Many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are present in reclaimed water, leading to concerns of human health risks from the consumption of food crops irrigated with reclaimed water. This study evaluated the potential for plant uptake and accumulation of four commonly occurring PPCP/EDCs, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA), diclofenac sodium (DCL), naproxen (NPX), and 4-nonylphenol (NP), by lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and collards (Brassica oleracea) in hydroponic culture, using 14C-labeled compounds. In both plant species, plant accumulation followed the order of BPA &gt; NP &gt; DCL &gt; NPX and accumulation in roots was much greater than in leaves and stems. Concentrations of 14C-PPCP/EDCs in plant tissues ranged from 0.22 ± 0.03 to 927 ± 213 ng/g, but nearly all 14C-residue was non-extractable. PPCP/EDCs, particularly BPA and NP, were also extensively transformed in the nutrient solution. Dietary uptake of these PPCP/EDCs by humans was predicted to be negligible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can enter terrestrial systems as sulfidised AgNPs (Ag2S-NPs) through the application of biosolids to soil. However, the bioavailability of Ag2S-NPs in soils is unknown. The two aims of this study were to investigate (1) the bioavailability of Ag to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) using a soil amended with biosolids containing Ag2S-NPs and (2) the effect of commonly used agricultural fertilisers/amendments on the bioavailability of Ag, AgNPs and Ag2S-NPs to lettuce. The study used realistic AgNP exposure pathways and exposure concentrations. The plant uptake of Ag from biosolids-amended soil containing Ag2S-NPs was very low for all Ag treatments (0.02%). Ammonium thiosulfate and potassium chloride fertilisation significantly increased the Ag concentrations of plant roots and shoots. The extent of the effect varied depending on the type of Ag. Ag2S-NPs, the realistic form of AgNPs in soil, had the lowest bioavailability. The potential risk of AgNPs in soils is low; even in the plants that had the highest Ag concentrations (Ag++thiosulfate), only 0.06% of added Ag was found in edible plant parts (shoots). Results from the study suggest that agricultural practises must be considered when carrying out risk assessments of AgNPs in terrestrial systems; such practises can affect AgNP bioavailability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Broccoli sprouts are a convenient and rich source of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, which can generate the chemopreventive agent, sulforaphane, an inducer of glutathione S-transferases (GST) and other cytoprotective enzymes. A broccoli sprout-derived beverage providing daily doses of 600 mmol glucoraphanin and 40 m mol sulforaphane was evaluated for magnitude and duration of pharmacodynamic action in a 12-week randomized clinical trial. Two hundred and ninety-one study participants were recruited from the rural He-He Township, Qidong, in the Yangtze River delta region of China, an area characterized by exposures to substantial levels of airborne pollutants. Exposure to air pollution has been associated with lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases. Urinary excretion of the mercapturic acids of the pollutants, benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde, were measured before and during the intervention using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Rapid and sustained, statistically significant ( P ≤ 0.01) increases in the levels of excretion of the glutathione-derived conjugates of benzene (61%), acrolein (23%), but not crotonaldehyde, were found in those receiving broccoli sprout beverage compared with placebo. Excretion of the benzene-derived mercapturic acid was higher in participants who were GSTT1-positive than in the null genotype, irrespective of study arm assignment. Measures of sulforaphane metabolites in urine indicated that bioavailability did not decline over the 12-week daily dosing period. Thus, intervention with broccoli sprouts enhances the detoxication of some airborne pollutants and may provide a frugal means to attenuate their associated long-term health risks. ©2014 AACR.},

   abstract = {The scarcity and pollution of freshwater are extremely crucial issues today, and the expansion of water reuse has been considered as an option to reduce its impact. This study aims to assess the efficiency of an integrated greywater treatment system and hydroponic lettuce production as a part of a green wall structure, and to evaluate the health risk associated with the production and consumption of lettuce through a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and a chemical health risk assessment. The study was conducted based on the unique configuration of a source separation system; an on-site greywater treatment system; a green wall structure as a polishing step; and hydroponic lettuce production in the green wall structure. The final effluent from the system was used to grow three lettuce varieties by adding urine as a nutrient solution. Both water samples and plant biomass were collected and tested for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and heavy metals contamination. The system has gained a cumulative 5.1 log10 reduction of E. coli in the final effluent and no E. coli found in the plant biomass. The estimated annual infection risk for Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, and Norovirus was 10-6-10-8, 10-8-10-10, and 10-10-10-11 respectively. These results indicate that the system attained the health-based targets, 10-6 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year. Similarly, the health risk index (HRI) and targeted hazard quotient (THQ) results did not exceed the permissible level, thus the chemical health risk concern was insignificant. © 2017 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Urban horticulture is gaining more and more attention in the context of sustainable food supply. Yet, cities are exposed to (former) industrial activities and traffic, responsible for emission of contaminants. Trace elements were monitored in soils located in the urban environment of Ghent (Belgium) and 84 samples of Lactuca satica L. lettuce grown on it. The effects of cultivation in soil versus trays, neighbouring traffic and washing of the lettuce before consumption were studied. The 0–30 cm top layer of soils appeared heterogenic in composition and enriched in Co, Cd, Ni and Pb within 10 m from the nearest road. Yet, no similar elevated concentrations could be found in the crops, except for As. Besides uptake from the roots, the presence of trace elements in the plants is also caused by the atmospheric deposition of airborne particulate matter on the leaf surface. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that this latter transport pathway might particularly be the case for Pt, Pd and Rh. Concentrations of Cd did not exceed the 0.2 mg kg−1 (fresh weight) threshold for Cd in leafy vegetables set by the European Commission. Measurements to reduce the health risks include the washing of lettuce, which effectively reduced the number of samples trespassing the maximum Pb level of 0.3 mg kg−1 (fresh weight). Also, cultivation in trays resulted in a lower As content in the plants. Taking into account a vigilance on crop selection, cultivation substrate and proper washing before consumption are considered essential steps for safe domestic horticulture in urban environments. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {An uptake and translocation study of azole compounds was performed in lamb's lettuce (Valerianella locusta L.) grown in nutrient solution fortified with different azoles. Three azoles, (clotrimazole, fluconazole and propiconazole), which have different physico-chemical properties and are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, were the compounds selected. An analytical method, based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) followed by LC-MS/MS determination, was developed to quantify these compounds in aqueous solution and in roots and leaves. The physicochemical properties of azoles are the main factors governing the uptake and plant accumulation. These azoles were detected in leaves indicating their transport within lamb's lettuce. Translocation from nutrient solution to the aerial part of lamb's lettuce was found to be highly dependent on the hydrophobicity of the azole. Clotrimazole accumulates in roots causing necrosis in roots and leaves, whereas fluconazole was the azole with the highest concentration in leaves without causing apparent phytotoxicity symptoms. The assessment of the levels of these azoles in leaves indicates that the risk for human health is negligible. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Industrial and municipal wastewaters are often used for irrigating agricultural fields in arid and semi-arid countries, representing the most attractive option to alleviate pressure on fresh-water resources. However, the wastewater may contain various potentially toxic elements and organic matters with highly harmful effects on human and animal health. During two growing seasons of globe artichoke, the effects of irrigation with secondary (SWW) and tertiary (TWW) municipal wastewater on heavy metal soil and plant content were evaluated, together with the consequent human risk from artichoke head consumption. The heavy metal contents (i.e., Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Mn) of the irrigation water, soil, plant, and yield were analyzed. Total and extractable heavy metals were quantified to determine the bioaccumulation factors, and the health risks to adults and children were determined according to hazard indices. The heavy metal contents of the artichoke heads harvested after SWW and TWW irrigation were lower than the international threshold values, and low bioaccumulation factors suggested that these heavy metals did not accumulate in the edible part of the artichoke crop. The hazard indices that were based on the consumption of the artichoke heads remained <1.0 for both adults and children, thus indicating that the health risks involving the different heavy metals are not significant.},

   abstract = {Chlorine remains the most popular method used by the fresh produce industry for decontamination. However, the occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBP) derived from chlorine-based disinfectants has been highlighted as a problem. After recent reports, chlorate residues in fresh produce are of concern in Europe. This study evaluated the chlorate accumulation in process wash water and the residues in fresh-cut lettuce when sodium hypochlorite was used as a wash aid. At a commercial processing facility, total chlorine was continually added to achieve a free chlorine level of 1-80 mg L-1 for water disinfection as the organic load measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased over time (1000-1500 mg O2 L-1). This resulted in chlorate accumulation (19-45 mg L-1) in the process water. When fresh-cut lettuce was washed in that water, chlorate residues were detected in the lettuce and the concentrations increased linearly with the repeated use of the same process water, reaching concentrations of 4.5-5.0 mg kg-1. To understand the chlorate accumulation in the process wash water, several experiments were performed at a pilot plant scale with different levels of COD and free chlorine. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlation (R = 0.91) between the total added chlorine and the chlorate accumulation in the process water. We demonstrated that the added chlorine needed to maintain a free chlorine level in the process water was the contributing factor to chlorate accumulation. Chlorate residues in the washed fresh-cut lettuce after rinsing for 1 min in tap water and in commercial bags were below the limit of quantification. This study contributes to the knowledge of chlorate accumulation in the process water when sodium hypochlorite was used as a sanitizer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Due to current water shortages, the use of water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for horticultural crop irrigation is becoming increasingly common. This practice implies the risk of introducing pharmaceutical compounds into the food chain. The main aim of this work was to study the accumulation of two drugs in lettuces and their subsequent transfer into the food chain. The study focused on two widely used drugs, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ) and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac (DCF), with different physicochemical properties in terms of their hydrophobicity and solubility in water. Three varieties of lettuce were selected and irrigated with water containing a mixture of the two pharmaceutical compounds at different concentrations. The results show the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bioconcentration factors in the case of CBZ; however, in the case of DCF, by contrast, the highest uptake levels and greatest bioconcentration factors were observed in the roots. For CBZ, the Cleaf/Croot ratio was greater than 1, indicating good root-to-leaf drug translocation, whereas all Cleaf/Croot ratios were less than 1 for DCF. From the data acquired, our evaluation suggests that the concentrations of CBZ and DCF detected in the edible part of the lettuces do not imply any risk to human health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the extent of their formation under cropping conditions is largely unknown. In this study, an analytical strategy to assess the conjugation of 11 CECs in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) irrigated with different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g L-1) of CECs was developed. The methodology involved enzymatic digestion with ss-glucosidase to obtain the total fraction (free form + conjugates) of CECs. The conjugation fraction was then obtained based on the difference. The highest extent of conjugation (i.e., 27 to 83%) was found with the most hydrophobic compounds, such as bisphenol A, carbamazepine, methyl paraben, and triclosan. So, the CEC conjugate fraction cannot be neglected in the estimate of human daily intake.},

   abstract = {The widespread distribution of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in the water cycle can lead to their incorporation in irrigated crops, posing a potential risk for human consumption. To gain further insight into the processes controlling the uptake of organic microcontaminants, Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grown under controlled conditions was watered with EOCs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, sulfonamides, β-blockers, phenolic estrogens, anticonvulsants, stimulants, polycyclic musks, biocides) at different concentrations (0-40μgL-1). Linear correlations were obtained between the EOC concentrations in the roots and leaves and the watering concentrations for most of the contaminants investigated. However, large differences were found in the root concentration factors (RCFi=0.27-733) and leaf translocation concentration factors (LTCFi=0-3) depending on the persistence of the target contaminants in the rhizosphere and the specific physicochemical properties of each one. With the obtained dataset, a simple predictive model based on a linear regression and the root bioconcentration and translocation factors can be used to estimate the concentration of the target EOCs in leaves based on the dose supplied in the irrigation water or the soil concentration. Finally, enantiomeric fractionation of racemic ibuprofen from the initial spiking mixture suggests that biodegradation mainly occurs in the rhizosphere. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Contaminants of emerging concern present in domestic waste streams include a highly diverse group of potentially biologically active compounds that can be detected at trace levels in wastewater. Concerns about potential uptake into crops arise when reclaimed water is used in food crop production. The present study investigated how 9 contaminants of emerging concern in reclaimed water are taken up into edible portions of two food crops. Two flame retardant chemicals, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and several polar pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) accumulated in a linear, concentration-dependent manner in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) irrigated with reclaimed water, suggesting passive uptake of both neutral and ionizable chemical contaminants in lettuce. Furthermore, concentration-dependent accumulation of TCEP and TCPP from reclaimed water was also observed in strawberry fruits (Fragaria ananassa). Collectively, these data suggest that highly polar or charged contaminants can be taken up by crops from water bearing contaminants of emerging concern and can be accumulated in the edible portions. Using these data, however, estimates of human exposure to these contaminants from reclaimed water food crop accumulation suggest that exposure to the contaminants of emerging concern examined in the present study is likely substantially lower than current exposure guidelines. © 2015 SETAC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitrites and nitrates are compounds considered harmful to humans and the major part of the daily intake of nitrates in foodstuffs is related to vegetable consumption. In this work, 150 leafy vegetables samples (75 spinach and 75 lettuce) were analysed in order to assess the levels of nitrites and nitrates. The analyses were carried out by a validated ion chromatography method and the samples with nitrate concentrations higher than legal limits and/or with quantifiable concentrations of nitrites were confirmed by an alternative ion chromatography method. RESULTS: Nitrate levels higher than legal limits were detected both in spinach (four samples) and in lettuce (five samples). Nitrite residues were registered both at low concentrations - lower than 28.5 mg kg-1 (12 spinach samples) - and at high concentrations, up to 197.5 mg kg-1 (three spinach and one lettuce sample). CONCLUSION: Considering the non-negligible percentage of 'not-compliant' samples for nitrates (6.0%), control is needed. Moreover, it is possible to suggest the introduction in the Communities Regulations of a 'maximum admissible level' for nitrites in leafy vegetables. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee substitutes made of roasted chicory are affected by the formation of acrylamide whose main precursor is asparagine. One strategy for limiting the formation of acrylamide is to reduce free asparagine in the chicory roots by lessening the supply of nitrogen in the field. However, decreasing nitrogen fertilizer could affect the formation of the volatile compounds and, consequently, the sensory characteristics of the roasted chicory. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the nitrogen supply in five commercial varieties on their aroma profile. RESULTS: The addition of 120 kg ha−1 of nitrogen fertilizer in the field resulted in a greater amount of pyrazines in the roasted chicory. Triangle tests were performed to determine the effect of the nitrogen level on the sensory quality of the five varieties. The results revealed that the chicory aroma was modified in two out of five varieties. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that a strategy aiming to limit the amount of acrylamide could affect the sensory quality of some varieties of chicory. Further acceptance tests need to be conducted to assess the effect (whether favourable or otherwise) on the sensory quality of the coffee substitutes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {Epidemiological evidence has suggested that consumption of a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables reduces the risk of several types of cancers and chronic degenerative diseases. In particular, broccoli sprouts are a convenient and rich source of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, which can release the chemopreventive agent, sulforaphane, an inducer of glutathione S-transferases. Two broccoli sprout-derived beverages, one sulforaphane-rich (SFR) and the other glucoraphanin-rich (GRR), were evaluated for pharmacodynamic action in a crossover clinical trial design. Study participants were recruited from the farming community of He Zuo Township, Qidong, China, previously documented to have a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma with concomitant exposures to aflatoxin and more recently characterized with exposures to substantive levels of airborne pollutants. Fifty healthy participants were randomized into two treatment arms. The study protocol was as follows: a 5 days run-in period, a 7 days administration of beverage, a 5 days washout period and a 7 days administration of the opposite beverage. Urinary excretion of the mercapturic acids of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, ethylene oxide and benzene were measured both pre- and postinterventions using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Statistically significant increases of 20-50% in the levels of excretion of glutathione-derived conjugates of acrolein, crotonaldehyde and benzene were seen in individuals receiving SFR, GRR or both compared with their preintervention baseline values. No significant differences were seen between the effects of SFR versus GRR. Intervention with broccoli sprouts may enhance detoxication of airborne pollutants and attenuate their associated health risks. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

   abstract = {After the severe accident at the Fukushima-1 Nuclear Power Plant in March 2011, radioactive contamination of food has become a matter of serious concern in Japan. There is considerable information about radioactive iodine and cesium, but little is known about uranium contamination. We determined uranium content in spinach by the Japanese official method (Manual on Radiation Measurement of Food in Emergency Situations). In the preliminary study, we confirmed that the use of a microwave digestion system for preparing the test solution of spinach could shorten the testing time and give acceptable results. The manual recommends the use of two elements (T1 and Bi) as internal standards for measurement of uranium by ICP-MS. We found that T1 was more suitable than Bi to quantify trace amounts of uranium in spinach. However, it was necessary to determine T1 or Bi concentrations in the sample before analysis, since some samples of spinach contained significant amounts of these elements. The uranium contents of 9 spinach samples bought in April and May 2011 were less than 10 μg/kg, which are very low compared to the provisional regulatory limit in Japan.},

   abstract = {Pesticide residues from the time of application until harvest were analysed for 20, 17 and 18 active insecticidal and fungicidal substances in Chinese cabbage, head cabbage and cauliflower, respectively. In total, 40 mathematical models of residue degradation were developed using a first-order kinetic equation, and from these models it was possible to forecast the action pre-harvest interval for a given action threshold for low-residue production in Brassica vegetables as a percentage of the maximum residue level. Additionally, it was possible to establish an action pre-harvest interval based on an action threshold of 0.01mgkg(1) for the production of Brassica vegetables for baby food. Among the evaluated commodities, the speed of residue degradation was highest in head cabbage, medium in Chinese cabbage and lowest in cauliflower. The half-lives of pesticide in various vegetables were also determined: they ranged from 1.55 to 5.25days in Chinese cabbage, from 0.47 to 6.54days in head cabbage and from 1.88 to 7.22days in cauliflower.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rocket is a popular salad vegetable used all over theworld and it hasmany health benefits.However, likewith all plantmaterial, there exists a danger of contamination with toxic substances. In the case of rocket, contamination with groundsel has occurred. Groundsel is a commonweed in rocket crops, and it contains very toxicpyrrolizidine alkaloids. In our study infrared spectroscopy was used to distinguish groundsel samples from rocket leaves. Infrared spectroscopy is a very simple analytical technique; however, somespecific conditions are more easily implemented in industrial environment than others. Someof these conditions and parameters of infrared spectroscopy were explored in detail. RESULTS: We tested for the influence of different parameters of attenuated total reflectance and transmission infrared method. Our results show that a 100 % correct classification can be obtained under conditions most suitable for industry: using fresh samples and parameters that enable fast spectralmeasurement. CONCLUSION: Infrared spectroscopy is a fast and easy-to-use method that has been shown to be able to differentiate between rocket and groundsel leaves. Therefore, it could be further studied for implementation in the safety control of rocket salads. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Seed sprouting for food is an alternative processing method. Because of the optimal temperature and moisture regime during sprouting process seeds are in a very good environment for the growth and development of micro-organisms, what can influence microbiological impurity and safety of the final product. Micro-organisms cause not only changes in sprouted seeds sensory quality but also synthesis of toxic compounds, harmful for human health. That is why disinfecting materials with fungicide action are the subjects of research already for many years. In 2007-2008 at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture research was carried out with the seeds of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cv. 'Warta', alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cv. 'Europa' and amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus L.) cv. 'Geltonukai'. Amounts of mycotoxins T-2, aflatoxin, ochratoxin, deoxinivalenol and zearalenon were detected in raw (not sprouted) and sprouted not disinfected and disinfected seeds. H2O2 (6%) and 1% grapefruit seeds extract were used for seeds disinfection in experiment. Using the 1% concentration Citrosept the amount of micromycetes and yeast fungi reduced but the genera of micromycetes which have ability to synthesize mycotoxins compete with other moulds and move them to their own place. Amounts of the most widely spread mycotoxins in various kinds of seeds differed. Zearalenon was predominated mycotoxin in raw alfalfa seeds, while aflatoxin was not detected. Not in all research samples disinfecting agents used for the mycotoxins disinfecting were effective. During sprouting process amounts of mycotoxins decreased.},

   abstract = {Engineered TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are present in a large variety of consumer products, and are produced in largest amount. The building industry is a major sector using TiO2-NPs, especially in paints. The fate of NPs after their release in the environment is still largely unknown, and their possible transfer in plants and subsequent impacts have not been studied in detail. The foliar transfer pathway is even less understood than the root pathway. In this study, lettuces were exposed to pristine TiO2-NPs and aged paint leachate containing TiO2-NPs and microparticles (TiO2-MPs). Internalization and in situ speciation of Ti were investigated by a combination of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Not only TiO2-NPs pristine and from aged paints, but also TiO2-MPs were internalized in lettuce leaves, and observed in all types of tissues. No change in speciation was noticed, but an organic coating of TiO2-NPs is likely. Phytotoxicity markers were tested for plants exposed to pristine TiO2-NPs. No acute phytotoxicity was observed; variations were only observed in glutathione and phytochelatin levels but remained low as compared to typical values. These results obtained on the foliar uptake mechanisms of nano- and microparticles are important in the perspective of risk assessment of atmospheric contaminations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Experimental data were assembled from the BAPPET database and Danish background data of As, Cd and Pb in soil, air and crops was collected. None of the models proved able to estimate the measured concentrations in plants from the BAPPET database with an absolute normalized error smaller than 70%. On average, the predictions had an error of 80-250%. However, when applying the models to the rural Danish background scenario, the NMF and other models predicted the concentrations in carrot and lettuce within the range of measured values. Regressions considering soil pH, organic matter and clay content were not superior to simple transfer factors. The transfer from air to plant is significant, at least under background conditions, and should be considered in the prediction methods. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the microcystins (MCs)-rich irrigation water effect on lettuce of different developmental stages, i.e. during a two months period, covering the whole period from seed germination to harvest at marketable size of the plant. We followed four lettuce plant groups receiving MCs-rich water (1.81 μg l−1 of dissolved MCs), originating from the Karla Reservoir, central Greece: 1) from seeds, 2) the cotyledon, 3) two true leaves and 4) four true leaves stages, all of which were compared to control plants that received tap water. Lettuce growth, photosynthetic performance, biochemical and mineral characteristics, as well as MCs accumulation in leaves, roots and soil were measured. The overall performance of lettuce at various developmental stages pointed to increased tolerance since growth showed minor alterations and non-enzymatic antioxidants remained unaffected. Plants receiving MCs-rich water from the seed stage exhibited higher photosynthetic capacity, chlorophylls and leaf nitrogen content. Nevertheless, considerable MCs accumulation in various plant tissues occurred. The earlier in their development lettuce plants started receiving MCs-rich water, the more MCs they accumulated: roots and leaves of plants exposed to MCs-rich water from seeds and cotyledons stage exhibited doubled MCs concentrations compared to respective tissues of the 4 Leaves group. Furthermore, roots accumulated significantly higher MCs amounts than leaves of the same plant group. Concerning human health risk, the Estimated Daily Intake values (EDI) of Seed and Cotyledon groups leaves exceeded Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) by a factor of 6, while 2 Leaves and 4 Leaves groups exceeded TDI by a factor of 4.4 and 2.4 respectively. Our results indicate that irrigation of lettuce with MCs-rich water may constitute a serious public health risk, especially when contaminated water is received from the very early developmental stages (seed and cotyledon). Finally, results obtained for the tolerant lettuce indicate that MCs bioaccumulation in edible tissues is not necessarily coupled with phytotoxic effects. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The accidental or continuous release of residual chlorine in water reclaimed for irrigational purposes could compromise the crop yield and increase the load of toxic organo-halogenated compounds, posing additional risks for environment and human health. This study was aimed at assessing the consequences of using chlorinated water for irrigating lettuce crops grown in pots with two different types of soil. The results show that the accumulation of extractable organo-halogenated compounds (EOX) in soil, roots and leaves is directly related to the chlorine concentration in the irrigation water. The accumulation of EOX in sandy soils is not significant, while it reached up to 300% of the control in the silty-clay soil, demonstrating that the phenomenon is linked to the organic matter content in the soil. The accumulation of EOX in the soil appears to play a significant role in subsequent bioaccumulation in cultures irrigated with tap water (long term memory effect). Chloramines also demonstrated to have similar impacts as the free chlorine from hypochlorite. The consistent bioaccumulation of 400–700 μgCl kg− 1 of EOX in the leaves of crops irrigated with just 0.2 mgCl L− 1 of residual chlorine, as compared to levels below the detection limit of 75 μgCl kg− 1 in the control crops, evidences the potential impact on food chain and human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irrigation water disinfection reduces the microbial load but it might lead to the formation and accumulation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the crop. If DBPs are present in the irrigation water, they can accumulate in the crop, particularly after the regrowth, and be affected by the postharvest handling such as washing and storage. To evaluate the potential accumulation of DBPs, baby lettuce was grown using irrigation water treated with electrolysed water (EW) in a commercial greenhouse over three consecutive harvests and regrowths. The impact of postharvest practices such as washing and storage on DBP content was also assessed. RESULTS: Use of EW caused the accumulation of chlorates in irrigation water (0.02–0.14 mg L−1), and in the fresh produce (0.05–0.10 mg kg−1). On the other hand, the disinfection treatment had minor impact regarding the presence of trihalomethanes (THMs) in water (0.3–8.7 μg L−1 max), and in baby lettuce (0.3–2.9 μg kg−1 max). CONCLUSIONS: Disinfection of irrigation water with EW caused the accumulation of chlorates in the crop reaching levels higher than the current maximum residual limit established in the EU legislation for leafy greens. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatments for the disinfection of irrigation water have to be evaluated by demonstration tests carried out under commercial settings taking into account not only their antimicrobial activity but also the potential phytotoxic effects on the crop. The consequences of the treatment of irrigation water with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) used for sprinkler irrigation of baby spinach in two commercial agricultural fields was assessed. RESULTS: Residual ClO2 levels at the sprinklers in the treated field were always below 1 mg L−1. ClO2 treatment provoked limited but statistically significant reductions in culturable Escherichia coli counts (0.2–0.3 log reductions), but not in the viable E. coli counts in water, suggesting the presence of viable but non-culturable cells (VBNC). Although disinfected irrigation water did not have an impact on the microbial loads of Enterobacteriaceae nor on the quality characteristics of baby spinach, it caused the accumulation of chlorates (up to 0.99 mg kg−1 in plants) and the reduction of the photosynthetic efficiency of baby spinach. CONCLUSION: Low concentrations of ClO2 are effective in reducing the culturable E. coli present in irrigation water but it might induce the VBNC state. Presence of disinfection by-products and their accumulation in the crop must be considered to adjust doses in order to avoid crop damage and chemical safety risks. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs) are globally used plasticizers and typical endocrine disruptors that can readily accumulate in agricultural products and represent a substantial risk to human health via the food chain. The range of soil properties has an important influence on the expression of PAE toxicity, and the mechanisms by which soil physical and chemical properties affect the expression of toxicity of target PAEs to plants and microorganisms requires further investigation. Important soil factors affecting the eco-toxicological effects of two typical PAEs, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a spiked soil were investigated in the present study. Soil at various pH values was spiked with three PAE concentrations (1, 5 and 20 mg DnBP or DEHP kg -1 soil), organic matter contents and water holding contents to simulate the greenhouse soil environment for 30 days. Their influence on the biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, various physiological changes and soil microbial communities was determined as endpoints. The toxicity to lettuce of DnBP was higher than that of DEHP in the soil and soil pH was the most important factor affecting their single toxicity, followed by soil organic matter content and soil moisture content in agreement with the Biolog test results. Under different soil conditions total protein, total soluble sugar and free amino acid contents were positively correlated with concentrations of the target PAEs, but leaf area, biomass, •O 2 - activity, vitamin C content and soil microbial diversity indices showed the opposite trend. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were more inhibited by DnBP together with impacts on indices of soil microbial diversity. The results suggest that soil conditions in greenhouses directly explain the patterns of pollutant toxicity displayed and impact the quantity, quality and food safety of vegetables produced using highly intensive production systems.

   abstract = {Peri-urban horticulture performs environmental and socio-economic functions and provides ecological services to nearby urban areas. Nevertheless, industrialization and water pollution have led to an increase in the exposure of peri-urban vegetables to contaminants such as trace elements (TEs) and organic microcontaminants (OMCs). In this study, the occurrence of chemical contaminants (i.e., 16 TEs, 33 OMCs) in soil and lettuce leaves from 4 farm fields in the peri-urban area of the city of Barcelona was assessed. A rural site, outside the peri-urban area of influence, was selected for comparison. The concentration of TEs and OMCs ranged from non-detectable to 803 mg/kg dw and from non-detectable to 397 mu g/kg dw respectively in the peri-urban soil, and from 6 . 10(-5) to 4.91 mg/kg fw and from non-detectable to 193 mu g/kg fw respectively in lettuce leaves. Although the concentration of Mo, Ni, Pb, and As in the soil of the peri-urban area exceeded the environmental quality guidelines, their occurrence in lettuce complied with human food standards (except for Pb). The many fungicides (carbendazim, dimetomorph, and methylparaben) and chemicals released by plastic pipelines (tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, bisphenol F, and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole) used in agriculture were prevalent in the soil and the edible parts of the lettuce. The occurrence of these chemical pollutants in the peri-urban area did not affect the chlorophyll, lipid, or carbohydrate content of the lettuce leaves. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) showed that soil pollution, fungicide application, and irrigation water quality are the most relevant factors determining the presence of contaminants in crops.

Material and Methods: A rapid colorimetric determination of nitrate in chard samples by nitration of salicylic acid was validated. The validated method was applied to analyze the content of nitrate in 56 chard samples marketed in Huesca (Spain) and collected in winter and summer seasons, and the toxicological risk associated with the intake for adult and children population was evaluated. Results: The method was specific and robust enough for the required purposes. The main performance characteristics of the method were: limits of detection and quantitation of 0.29 mg L-1 and 0.59 mg L-1, respectively; recoveries from 80.0% to 107.4%; and coefficients of variation lower than 11.4%. The detected mean nitrate content was 2293 mg kg-1 and there was evidence of risk only for extreme consumers (adults and children), especially in winter period. Conclusions: A high percentage of chard samples with a considerable concentration of nitrate were found. Taking into account the estimated dairy intake of nitrate associated with them, it could be recommended to establish a regulatory limit of nitrate to chard, a vegetable of important consumption in Spain.},

   abstract = {Soil pollution is more and more serious to human health. On the one hand, the pollution area is getting larger and larger, on the other hand, soil organic pollutants can be absorbed by plants, and may end up being eaten by people, which can cause serious damage to human health. Among the organic pollutants, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is one of the most important pollutants in soil, and should need to be removed urgently. Phytoremediation is a potentially profitable remediation technology, which not only greatly saves costs, but also improves the efficiency of PAH removal. In order to further study the biodegradation of bioavailable PAHs by plant root exudates, artificial cultivation of celery in the soil contaminated with phenanthrene and pyrene was carried out. Soil samples were collected at different time intervals to determine the residual contents of various phenanthrene and pyrene forms in soil. Meanwhile, the content of pyrene in celery was also determined to investigate the effects of celery uptake on the adsorption and desorption of PAHs in the plant-soil system. The results showed that celery root exudates and the stimulated microorganisms significantly improved the degradation of PAHs in the soil. After 12 weeks of cultivation, the degradation rates for the available fraction, desorbing fraction and non-desorbing fraction of phenanthrene and pyrene in the soil were 89.3%, 91.1%, 71.3% and 82.4%, 84.6% and 60.0%, respectively, and the desorbing fraction was the main form of PAHs degraded in soil. With a certain uptake effect on PAHs in the soil, the celery could affect the adsorption and desorption of PAHs in the plant-soil system, but the proportion of the uptake amount to the removal amount of desorbing fraction in the soil was extremely small. Therefore, root exudates combined with rhizosphere microorganisms can promote the removal of organic pollutants when using the phytoremediation for soil remediation, and the main functional mechanism is the microbial degradation stimulated by root exudates. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

   abstract = {Chromium (Cr) contamination in arable soils and irrigating water remains a priority, particularly due to the challenges posed to crop production and food safety. Long-term Cr(VI) effects remain less addressed than short-term ones, particularly regarding organ-specific genotoxic profiles. Here we used the crop Lactuca sativa growing in a protected horticultural system and irrigated for 21 days with Cr(VI) (up to 200 mg/L). Besides the oxidative stress, the genotoxicity was evaluated. Shoots and roots showed distinctive oxidative stress status and genotoxic effects, in a dose-dependent manner. While 50 mg/L stimulated antioxidant activities and no major genotoxic effects were found, plants exposed to ≥150 showed an increase of oxidative disorders, together with cytostatic and DNA damage effects, and some mitotic impairment. Leaves showed less oxidative signs at 50 mg/L, while at 150/200 mg/L the antioxidant battery was stimulated. In Cr treated plants, the highest dose increased the DNA damage, reinforcing the idea that DNA breaks were related to mitotic disorders in higher doses. In conclusion, long-term exposure data show a highly responsive root, with a quadratic response meaning higher defenses at lower Cr doses, and higher oxidative and DNA damage and cytostatic effect at a higher dose.

   abstract = {The paper investigates the migration of the acrylamide monomer (AMD) to lettuce chosen as a test plant growing in an organic medium (peat substrate). Polyacrylamide (PAM)-based flocculant added to the growing medium contained no more than 1000 mg kg−1 of AMD. Plants were grown with varied doses of PAM preparation (0.5–3.0 mg dm– 3 of peat substrate) to compare the results with the control sample. The determination of AMD content, chlorophyll content, weight of the lettuce head, and also analysis of macro- and micro-elements in lyophilised test material was made under the same analytical conditions. The results showed that lettuce plants absorb AMD to the leaves from the peat substrate. The AMD uptake has a negative impact on the growth of lettuce. It reduces the average fresh weight of heads and destabilises the mineral composition of the plant. Therefore, concern related to the transfer risk of the residual AMD from sludge used for organic fertilisation of edible plants still remains a crucial question from a food and consumer safety point of view. To ensure consumer safety, the fate of the AMD following the application of PAM to cropland should be carefully monitored in the whole food chain. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {The aim was to assess acrylamide monomer (AMD) uptake by hydroponically grown lettuce. Lettuce was cultivated by applying plant tissue testing in a recycled system by the use of nutrient solutions prepared with two water-soluble flocculants F3 and F4 containing 176 and 763 mg kg-1 of AMD, respectively. The effects on growth, fresh weight and plant leaf quality were evaluated by comparing these treatments and one control standard nutrient solution typically recommended for lettuce hydroponic cultivation. To assess the nutritional status of lettuce, samples were collected and lyophilised before determination of the selected micro- and macro-element contents. An HPLC with photodiode array detector method was applied to determine AMD in both selected flocculants and dried plant samples. Results show that lettuces cultivated under the conditions described above absorb AMD from nutrient solutions into their leaves. The AMD presence in recycled nutrient solutions has a negative influence on the growth of lettuce, reducing their average fresh weight and average number of leaves. The study confirmed that the problem of AMD mobility and its accumulation risk in plants should to be an important topic with respect to safe polyacrylamide (PAM) handling in the agro food area. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

However, these pollutants could be monitored through bioaccumulation using aquatic plant, Pistia stratiotes. Thus, the present research aims to determine the effectiveness of P. stratiotes in the bioaccumulation of rare earth metals through phytoremediation. The study was carried out by subjecting the plant to 5 levels of lanthanum chloride treatment for 7 days. The plant samples (root and leaf sections) were digested prior to metal accumulation analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results from the analysis showed that lanthanum accumulated in both the root and leaf sections of P. stratiotes. The highest concentration of lanthanum was found in the root section (0.272 mu g kg(-1)) on the 2nd day compared to the leaf section (0.0124 mu g kg-1) on the 6th day, when both parts were treated with 1.0 ppm. The study indicates that this aquatic plant can be used to remediate environmental wastewater from REE contamination because of its bioaccumulation capability.},

   abstract = {Reports on the occurrence of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) have increased worldwide because of CYN toxic effects in humans and animals. If contaminated waters are used for plant irrigation, these could represent a possible CYN exposure route for humans. For the first time, a method employing solid phase extraction and quantification by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) of CYN was optimized in vegetables matrices such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The validated method showed a linear range, from 5 to 500 ng CYN g−1 of fresh weight (f.w.), and detection and quantitation limits (LOD and LOQ) of 0.22 and 0.42 ng CYN g−1 f.w., respectively. The mean recoveries ranged between 85 and 104%, and the intermediate precision from 12.7 to 14.7%. The method showed to be robust for the three different variables tested. Moreover, it was successfully applied to quantify CYN in edible lettuce leaves exposed to CYN-contaminated water (10 µg L−1), showing that the tolerable daily intake (TDI) in the case of CYN could be exceeded in elderly high consumers. The validated method showed good results in terms of sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and robustness for CYN determination in leaf vegetables such as lettuce. More studies are needed in order to prevent the risks associated with the consumption of CYN-contaminated vegetables. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Hydroponic production of leafy vegetables sustains consumption of fresh produce all year round. However, cultivation of leafy vegetables in a growing medium prepared from water contaminated with trace elements, particularly manganese (Mn), may affect both the plant products and their consumers. Therefore, an attempt was made in the present study to evaluate the effect of treating two cultivars of lettuce (cv. Locarno and cv. Satine) with Mn (0.5 – control, 5, 25 and 50 mg dm-3) on (i) the concentration of Mn and other elements, (ii) biomass accumulation, (iii) the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus, (iv) the levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species), (v) the activity of antioxidative enzymes, and (vi) the content of phenolic compounds. Increased concentrations of Mn in the growing medium led to a significantly higher concentration of this element in lettuce leaves (up to a 9.4-fold increase), but concentrations of potassium, calcium and magnesium were almost unchanged. Although the intensity of photosynthesis was lower in both of the examined cultivars, biomass accumulation was slightly reduced only in cv. Locarno. The recorded toxic effect of Mn most probably resulted from the induced generation of ROS, levels of which usually increase albeit insignificantly in plants treated with the tested metal. Higher generation of ROS was to some extent counteracted by the increased activity of antioxidative enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase and catalase) and a higher content of phenolic compounds. The results of this study demonstrate that increased accumulation of Mn in lettuce not only impairs the plant growth, but may also pose a risk to human health, as these plant products may become dietary sources of Mn and elevated levels of ROS. © 2017, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

In this study fresh leafy green vegetables, both pre-cut and uncut, were sampled at retail in all 20 Italian regions and tested for pathogens and pesticide residues contamination. Both in pre-cut and in uncut vegetables 1.00% of samples tested positive for pathogens investigated. Pesticide residues were detected in 53.33% of samples, pre-cut vegetables were more often contaminated (59.06%) than uncut vegetables (47.68%). Samples tested positive from one (monoresidual samples, 27.33%) to seven chemical compounds (multiresidual samples, 26.00%). Maximum Residual Levels (MRL) established by European legislation were exceeded in two multiresidual samples of uncut romaine lettuce (overall non-compliant prevalence 0.67%). A few samples resulted non-compliant for MRL or contaminated by pathogens. Nevertheless in more than half of the samples analysed pesticide residues were found; furthermore vegetables encompassed in this survey are eaten raw and process does not include any effective microbial elimination step. These findings can suggest that public health risk remains, especially regarding pre-cut vegetables. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Abstract Recent droughts in the southwestern United States have heightened the interest in using more reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation. Treated wastewater effluent is a source of irrigation water and contains many pharmaceutical microcontaminants. Currently, there is little knowledge on if these microconstituents will enter food crops and if so where they will be found within the plant. For this experiment, the uptake of 17α-ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine HCl (Prozac®), and ibuprofen within different sections of a celery stalk over a 24-h time period was examined. Results found that all of these pharmaceuticals were taken up into the celery stalks within 24 h. Ibuprofen was found to have reached concentrations of 1 μg/g within the leaves in just 1 h. Metabolites of the ibuprofen were also detected at all locations within the stalk for all time periods. The concentration of EE2 in the submerged section of the stalk was found to increase from 0.031 to 0.911 μg/g of celery in just 23 h. The EE2 began to rise higher within the stalk to reach a concentration of 8.94 ng/g about 6 in above the base after 24 h. Fluoxetine HCl concentrations rose to 0.832 μg/g of celery within the submerged section of the stalk during the 24 h. After 12 h, fluoxetine HCl was detected within the bottom 4 in of the stalk. EE2, fluoxetine HCl, and ibuprofen all exhibit potential for uptake within food crops. Further studies on additional food crops and pharmaceuticals would be required to assess the full risk posed to human eating food crops irrigated with treated wastewater effluent. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

   abstract = {We studied corticosterone occurrence in lettuce plants grown on three biosolids amended soils under irrigation with either tap water or secondary wastewater effluent. Corticosterone was examined as it has possible implications for human health. It is a major glucocorticoid, and as such has an effect on regulation of metabolism, immune functions and stress response. The plants were grown in 220-L lysimeters packed with 3 soils which represent a wide range of physicochemical properties. Lettuce was grown in cycles (two in summer and two in winter) during 3years, and in every spring season the sludges were re-applied. Corticosterone was quantified using ELISA and LCMS, and was found in the biosolids, tap water, wastewater effluent and lettuce plants. The respective ranges of concentrations were: 11-92ngg-1, 0.5-1.6ngL-1, 4.2-4.7ngL-1; and 1-900ngg-1 dry weight. A positive relationship was found between corticosterone concentrations in winter-grown lettuces and the plants fresh weight. The corticosterone content of the plants did not correspond with either the type of irrigation water or the biosolids type and rate of application or the soil properties. © 2015.},

   abstract = {One of the major concerns for human health in the past decade is the potential dangers posed by increased concentrations of steroidal hormones in soils and water. These hormones are considered to be endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), which may harm human health when exposed to high concentrations, or in the case of long term exposure to lower concentrations. In a 3. year study, two steroids, estrone and testosterone, were measured in lettuce plants irrigated with wastewater effluents and freshwater and treated with several types of biosolids.The relative contribution of the different factors, mainly irrigation water and biosolids, to the hormone levels in the lettuce plants was determined. It was found that irrigation water, which contained significant amounts of hormones, had the most substantial effect, whereas biosolids had only minor influence on hormone levels in the lettuce.The hormone levels in the plants were compared to the FDA recommendation for daily consumption in food, and were found to exceed the recommended level (when consumed by a typical individual), and therefore could have negative physiological impacts.Overall this study shows that biosolids have little effect on hormone uptake by lettuce, and it emphasizes the negative impact of irrigation water on these levels, which is of concern to public health. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Isolates were identified as A. alternata, A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. brassicicola and A. japonica. Pathogenicity was evaluated on plants under greenhouse conditions. Two isolates showed low level of virulence on cultivated rocket while the other isolates showed medium or high level of virulence. Isolates were also characterized for their mycotoxin production on a modified Czapek-Dox medium. Production of the five Alternaria toxins, tenuazonic acid, alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, altenuene and tentoxin were evaluated.

   abstract = {Fungi belonging to the genus Alternaria are common pathogens of fruit and vegetables with some species able to produce secondary metabolites dangerous to human health. Twenty-eight Alternaria isolates from rocket and cabbage were investigated for their mycotoxin production. Five different Alternaria toxins were extracted from synthetic liquid media and from plant material (cabbage, cultivated rocket, cauliflower). A modified Czapek-Dox medium was used for the in vitro assay. Under these conditions, more than 80% of the isolates showed the ability to produce at least one mycotoxin, generally with higher levels for tenuazonic acid. However, the same isolates analyzed in vivo seemed to lose their ability to produce tenuazonic acid. For the other mycotoxins; alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, altenuene and tentoxin a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo production was observed. In vitro assay is a useful tool to predict the possible mycotoxin contamination under field and greenhouse conditions. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Significant increase of the 137Cs+ uptake by lettuce plants and the decrease of 137Cs+ translocation efficiency from roots to leaves were observed in 50 % HM deficient in K+ and NH4 + ions. Speciation analysis using Visual MINTEQ program showed that at micromolar concentration of CsCl (5μmol/dm3) in 50 % HM at pH 6.0 and 25°C, cesium was occurred practically only in the free cationic Cs+ form. 98.8 %, with minor proportions of other cesium species: CsCl - 0.4 %, CsNO3 - 0.4 %, and CsSO4 - 0.4 %. Surplus of Cl-, NO3 - and SO4 2- ions in HM causes the increase of proportions of the cesium species CsCl, CsNO3 and CsSO4 -, respectively at the expense of bioavailable Cs+ form. Radiocesium 137Cs taken up via roots was removed from lettuce leaves with high efficiency by boiling in diluted NaCl solution. At ambient temperature the extraction of 137Cs with diluted acetic acid was concentration and time dependent process, and was succeeded by leakage of tissue components absorbing at 260 nm. These findings are important for the risk assessment of radiocesium entry into the food chain via contaminated leafy vegetable. © 2012, Versita. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In washed spinach, a maximum Cd concentration of 0.20 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) is allowed according to European regulations. Producers experience that this concentration can sometimes be exceeded even on soils with baseline Cd concentrations. There is a growing need to quantify the factors determining Cd uptake in the crop in order to anticipate the risk of exceedance when selecting a field for cultivation. Interseasonal variation in precipitation may be one of the factors influencing Cd uptake by crops. A pot experiment was set up where spinach plants were subject to different watering regimes. Treatment with more limited water supply during periods of high demand resulted in significantly higher accumulated Cd concentrations (0.25–0.31 versus 0.17–0.23 mg/kg FW). Concentrations at or above the maximum allowed limit were of concern, considering that the soil used in the experiment originated from a typical field in an agricultural region without any specific contamination. Probabilities to exceed maximum concentrations in the different watering regimes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggested that the watering regimes significantly determine the effective risk of exceeding the maximum concentrations. Their effects may be of high practical importance in the field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Metal uptake by plants occurs by soil-root transfer but also by direct transfer of contaminants from the atmosphere to the shoots. This second pathway may be particularly important in kitchen gardens near industrial plants. The mechanisms of foliar uptake of lead by lettuce (Lactuca sativa) exposed to the atmospheric fallouts of a lead-recycling plant were studied. After 43daysof exposure, the thoroughlywashedleaves contained 335 ± 50 mg Pb kg -1 (dry weight). Micro-X-ray fluorescence mappings evidenced Pb-rich spots of a few hundreds of micrometers in diameter located in necrotic zones. These spots were more abundant at the base of the central nervure. Environmental scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed that smaller particles (a few micrometers in diameter) were also present in other regions of the leaves, often located beneath the leaf surface.Inaddition,submicrometricparticleswereobservedinside stomatal openings. Raman microspectrometry analyses of the leaves identified smelter-originated Pb minerals but also secondary phases likely resulting from the weathering of original particles. On the basis of these observations, several pathways for foliar lead uptake are discussed. A better understanding of these mechanisms may be of interest for risk assessment of population exposure to atmospheric metal contamination. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Chlorine was assessed as a reconditioning agent and wash water disinfectant in the fresh-cut produce industry. Artificial freshcut lettuce wash water, made from butterhead lettuce, was used for the experiments. In the reconditioning experiments, chlorine was added to artificial wash water inoculated with Escherichia coli O157 (6 log CFU/ml). Regression models were constructed based on the inactivation data and validated in actual wash water from leafy vegetable processing companies. The model that incorporated chlorine dose and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the wash water accurately predicted inactivation. Listeria monocytogenes was more resistant to chlorine reconditioning in artificial wash water than Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157. During the washing process with inoculated lettuce (4 log CFU/g), in the absence of chlorine, there was a rapid microbial buildup in the water that accumulated to 5.4±0.4 log CFU/100 ml after 1 h. When maintaining a residual concentration of 1 mg/liter free chlorine, wash water contamination was maintained below 2.7, 2.5, and 2.5 log CFU/100 ml for tap water and artificial process water with COD values of 500 and 1,000 mg O2/liter, respectively. A model was developed to predict water contamination during the dynamic washing process. Only minor amounts of total trihalomethanes were formed in the water during reconditioning. Total trihalomethanes accumulated to larger amounts in the water during the wash water disinfection experiments and reached 124.5±13.4 μg/liter after 1 h of execution of the washing process in water with a COD of 1,000 mg O2/liter. However, no total trihalomethanes were found on the fresh-cut lettuce after rinsing. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

This study investigated the toxic effects of MCLR, LAS and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and evaluated MCLR accumulation level in lettuce with or without LAS. The changes in seed germination and shoot/root growth, responses of the antioxidative defense system, and the accumulation of MCLR in lettuce were tested to evaluate the single and combined toxic effect of MCLR and LAS in well-controlled conditions. The results showed that seedling growth (except for root elongation and leaf weight) was more sensitive to toxicant exposure than seed germination. For seedling leaves, lipid peroxidation was not observed when the antioxidative defense system (including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) was activated to relieve the adverse effects of oxidative stress via different pathways. Our results also confirmed that the interaction between MCLR and LAS was synergistic. Both toxicants in combination not only significantly inhibited seedling growth, but also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as the contents of glutathione. Furthermore, LAS dramatically enhanced the accumulation of MCLR in the plant, thus leading to a reduction in quality and yield and posing greater potential risk to humans via consumption of these edible plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the behaviour of strobilurin and carbocyamides commonly used in chemical protection of lettuce depending on carefully selected effective microorganisms (EM) and yeast (Y). Additionally, the assessment of the chronic health risk during a 2-week experiment was performed. The statistical method for correlation of physico-chemical parameters and time of degradation for pesticides was applied. In this study, the concentration of azoxystrobin, boscalid, pyraclostrobin and iprodione using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) in the matrix of lettuce plants was performed, and there was no case of concentration above maximum residues levels. Before harvest, four fungicides and their mixture with EM (1 % and 10 %) and/or yeast 5 % were applied. In our work, the mixtures of 1%EM + Y and 10%EM + Y both stimulated and inhibited the degradation of the tested active substances. Adding 10%EM to the test substances strongly inhibited the degradation of iprodione, and its concentration decreased by 30 %, and in the case of other test substances, the degradation was approximately 60 %. Moreover, the addition of yeast stimulated the distribution of pyraclostrobin and boscalid in lettuce leaves. The risk assessment for the pesticides ranged from 0.4 to 64.8 % on day 1, but after 14 days, it ranged from 0.0 to 20.9 % for children and adults, respectively. It indicated no risk of adverse effects following exposure to individual pesticides and their mixtures with EM and yeast. © 2015, The Author(s).},

In this study, we identified three loose-leaf lettuce cultivars with low accumulation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a highly toxic and persistent organic pollutant. PFOA concentrations in the shoots of low-PFOA cultivars were 3.7–5.5-fold lower than those of high-PFOA cultivars. The identification of low-PFOA cultivars could contribute to ensuring food safety despite cultivation in highly polluted soils (1 mg/kg) based on the tolerable daily PFOA intake (1.5 μg/kg/d). We detected lower desorbing fractions of PFOA in rhizosphere soil, lower bioconcentration factors, and higher distribution in the cell walls and organelles of roots in low-PFOA cultivars, all of which are key factors in limiting PFOA uptake and translocation from soil to shoots, than in high-PFOA cultivars. This study reveals the mechanism of PFOA uptake from soil to crop and lays a foundation for establishing a cost-effective strategy to plant crops in polluted soil and reduce exposure risk due to persistent organic pollutants in crops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is a toxic and persistent organic pollutant that can be widely detected in agricultural soils. In this study, two lettuce cultivars with low PFOS accumulation were screened out to reduce the exposure of PFOS to the human body via vegetable consumption. The screened low-PFOS cultivars may help to ensure food safety, despite planting in highly PFOS-polluted soils (1.0 mg/kg), due to their high tolerance to PFOS and 4.4-5.7 times lower shoot PFOS concentration than the high-PFOS cultivars. Protein content and protein-mediated transpiration played key roles in regulating PFOS accumulation in the lettuce cultivars tested. Lower protein content, lower stomatal conductance, and lower transpiration rate resulted in low PFOS accumulation. This study reveals the mechanism of forming low-PFOS accumulation of lettuce cultivars at physiological and biochemical levels and lays a foundation for developing a cost-effective and safe approach to grow vegetables in PFOS-polluted soils.

   abstract = {Vacuum impregnation (VI) has been widely utilized as a pre-treatment method prior to, e.g., the minimal processing, freezing, or drying of foods. In many cases, VI has been used to focus on the enrichment of fruits and vegetables with probiotics or micronutrients, texture enhancement, the modification of the sensory attributes, and extension of shelf life by pH reduction. However, little attention has been paid to the exploration of the metabolic consequences of VI that could lead to changes in the quality characteristics of plant tissues. Since nitrate has long been discussed as a compound that is harmful to human health, the aim of this investigation was to reduce the nitrate content in spinach leaves by feeding sucrose into the tissue using VI. The leaves, either non-treated or treated with VI, were stored under saturated humidity conditions and in darkness at 8 °C, for up to 72 h. VI-treated leaves showed a remarkable reduction in nitrate content as compared to the non-treated samples. Upon storage, sucrose was reduced, indicating that this sugar had been respired and had induced metabolization of the stored nitrate. The nitrite content of the treated leaves was unaffected, proving that this toxic compound was not accumulated in the baby spinach leaves upon external sucrose feeding. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Phthalate ester (PAE) accumulation in crops poses great risks to human health and has aroused great concern. Here, we investigated variations in di-n-butylphthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) accumulation by various Chinese flowering cabbage cultivars and revealed their variation mechanism. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in shoot PAE concentrations of 28 cultivars. Moreover, significant positive correlations between DBP and DEHP concentrations in shoots of all cultivars indicated that they could be taken up simultaneously by various cultivars. Due to the lower translocation factor of low-PAE accumulator, its shoot PAEs concentrations were much lower than root compared to high-PAE accumulator. Further, subcellular distribution showed that PAE concentrations of root cell walls and organelles were much higher than those of shoots in low-PAE accumulator. Therefore, lower translocation from root to shoot and more PAEs accumulating in cell walls and organelles of root might act as main formation mechanism of low-PAE accumulator. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a metal pollutant that accumulates in cultivated soils and has detrimental consequences in terms of food safety. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) can be characterised as having a high capacity to accumulate Cd in its tissues.An analysis of Cd tolerance and Cd accumulation was carried out using two varieties of lettuce ('Divina' and 'Melina').A wide range of CdCl2 concentrations was used (0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 3.0, and 15.0 μM CdCl2). The lowest concentration (0.1 μM CdCl2) stimulated growth, while the two highest concentrations resulted in a reduction in biomass. Cadmium concentrations were found to be twice as high in roots as in shoots.'Divina' displayed lower concentrations of Cd than 'Melina' in nearly all treatments. A strong negative correlation was observed between Cd concentration and Cd tolerance in the roots and shoots (R2 &gt; 0.87) of both 'Melina' and 'Divina'. Lettuce grown in the presence of 15.0 μM CdCl2 had leaf Cd concentrations that were 100-fold higher than the legal maximum level for vegetable products marketed for human consumption, but showed no symptoms of dehydration, chlorosis, or necrosis. This result represents an important alert for lettuce consumers and growers.},
