   abstract = {Quetta, the capital city of Baluchistan province which was once called as "little London" has been affected by severe drought since 1998. This situation led to fresh water shortage which compelled the local population to irrigate their crops by waste water. In this way, heavy metals started to accumulate in the soil and as well as in our food chain. The main objectives of this research were to elucidate the effect of waste water on leafy vegetables growth. For this purpose, three leafy vegetables were selected i.e. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum), Purslane (Portulaca oleracea) and Lettuce (Lectuca sativa). The research is also aimed to know the influence of waste water treated plants on human health. The experiments were performed in the botanical garden, Botany Department, University of Baluchistan. Waste water was collected from waste water channels of the Quetta city. From March 2016-14 June, 2016, after an extensive survey, different sites of the municipal were selected for the collection of waste water used as sample collected from the Agriculture Department of Quetta city. Vegetative growth parameters such as height, number of leaves, weight of fresh, dry leaves and rate of germination of seed were measured to know the impact of waste water treatment. Waste water treatment had found a significant effect on the growth of leafy plants. All the growth parameters were measured in the three selected leafy vegetable plant species i.e. Coriander (Corianderum sativum), Purslane (Portulaca oleracae) and Lactuca (Lactuca sativa). Comparatively, better results were found by treating the plant with waste water rather than fresh water. The usage of municipal wastewater for irrigation can be an abundant resource of the nutrients essential for plant's growth. However, keeping in view the health hazards, edible crops irrigated with this untreated waste water should not be grown in spite of its positive impact on the physical parameters of some plants.},

   abstract = {The plant phyllosphere has been defined as a complex, dynamic and ephemeral system harboring a wide variety of microorganisms. Changes in the microbiota of fruit and vegetables have been proven to affect the quality and safety of fresh fruit and vegetables. Several authors have demonstrated that changes in the environment and agricultural practices of primary production affect the plant phyllosphere but also the presence of transient colonizers such as foodborne pathogens. The quality of the irrigation water has been recognized as a critical factor to reduce contamination of fresh produce with plant and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Among the potential intervention strategies available for growers to reduce microbial risk associated to irrigation water, disinfection of irrigation water represents one of the most efficient approaches. There are several commercially available treatments including chlorine dioxide (ClO2), which is an efficient disinfection treatment for irrigation water. However, the impact of residual ClO2 concentrations, present in treated irrigation water, on the bacterial community of leafy greens has not been evaluated so far. In this study, the impact of ClO2 for the disinfection of irrigation water constantly applied to grow baby spinach in commercial production fields, on the plant microbial community was evaluated. Baby spinach was sampled at the commercial stage (12-15 cm long measured from the petiole) from plots (0.5-0.8 ha) irrigated with untreated and ClO2 treated water. Control and treated plants were analysed using next generation sequencing. In terms of bacterial community structure, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and the ANOSIM (R=0.008, p=0.29) test based on Bray-Curtis similarities did not show significant differences between control and ClO2 treated samples. Regarding the bacterial community composition, the sequences showed that the continuous disinfection of irrigation water with ClO2 decreased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae of baby spinach by 14 and 19%, respectively, compared to untreated samples. These results were also confirmed using specific qPCR primers for the quantification of these genera. This is a remarkable finding because about 30% of fresh produce losses are attributed to proliferation of the Pseudomonas and safety concerns have been attributed to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Their use has greatly increased in the last decades and its' continuous application lead to added pesticides concentration in soil. Consequently, SPs may enter the food chain, affecting the environment and human health. The degradation over time of the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin applied to cabbages was monitored. The evolution was followed both on cabbages and the surrounding soils, and the soil microbial community characterized by next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The main shift in the microbial community structure was observed during the first 30 days after pesticides' application. The modification in the microbial community composition, where an increased abundance of Nocardioides sp. and Sphingomonas sp. were observed, was correlated respectively with the conversions of deltamethrin and its metabolite, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA). Although deltamethrin was not found in any of the tested samples (soil and cabbage) after 180 days, it caused an environmental impact much further than the 7 days security interval. These findings suggest that deltamethrin application can disturb soil microbial community and that natural biodegradation can have an important part in pesticides soil decontamination.

In the United States, rooftop harvested rainwater is most commonly used for irrigation. Rooftop harvested rainwater may contain contaminants from bird or animal feces that may present a risk to water users. Different roofing materials may influence the survival of fecal bacteria on the rooftop prior to runoff during rainfall. In this study, three pathogen groups (E. coli, enterococci and Salmonella enterica) in rooftop runoff from three, replicated roof types (asphalt shingle, synthetic slate, and wood shake) were quantified in multiple rain events. Matched roofs were selected from locations with differing amounts of tree cover. Enterococci were the most frequently detected bacteria from all roof types. Wood shake and asphalt shingle roofing materials had the poorest microbial water quality. Rainwater runoff from two of the six buildings failed to meet United States Food and Drug Administration microbial standards for irrigation water. A quantitative microbial risk assessment indicated that the annual probability of illness from consuming lettuce irrigated with rooftop harvested rainwater varied by roofing material, irrigation water withholding period, and exposure frequency. Consuming lettuce immediately after irrigation with rooftop rainwater presented the highest human health risk based on the probability of illness from E. coli and enterococci exposure. Withholding irrigation by 1 day prior to harvest decreased the annual probability of illness from E. coli by 2 log, but had a minimal effect on the risk from enterococci. © 2018},

The different sanitizers vary in their ability to reduce microorganisms, and chlorine, in its different forms, is widely used in food for this purpose. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of three different types of commercial domestic sanitizers in the reduction of microbial load on in natura crisp lettuce from conventional cultivation. Method: Five lots of three different chlorine-based sanitizers used for lettuce sanitization were studied. Concentration of free chlorine and the existence of thermotolerant coliforms and Salmonella spp were investigated in the lettuce samples after sanitization. Results: Only one of the evaluated sanitizers obtained free chlorine concentration between 100 and 200 ppm. All lettuce samples showed an absence of Salmonella sp./25 g and 60% of them had no reduction of coliform at 45 degrees C to acceptable levels for the product to be suitable for consumption. Conclusions: The tested products were not effective in reducing the microbial load of lettuce to safe levels, which may be putting the health of the consumer at risk. However, more studies are needed to elucidate issues related to the food hygiene process.},

   abstract = {Synergistic antimicrobial effect of a simultaneous UV-A light and propyl paraben (PP) treatment against Escherichia coli O157:H7 is demonstrated. While other parabens with shorter chain length (methyl and ethyl) showed minimal antimicrobial effect, 3 mM PP with UV-A light achieved more than 5 log [CFU/ml] reduction in bacterial population within 30 min in aqueous solution with a D-value of 4.89 ± 0.66 min. Neither UV-A light or 3 mM PP was able to achieve more than 1.5 logarithmic reduction, underscoring the synergy of the simultaneous treatment. Membrane damage as detected via propidium iodide assay was a dominant mechanism of action. The simultaneous treatment could reduce the risk of cross-contamination during washing of spinach without negatively impairing its color, chlorophyll content, or total phenolic content. Approximately, 75% of the paraben residue from the treatment could be effectively removed with a subsequent rinsing step. The proposed technology is an attractive approach to improve the safety of fresh produce. Practical applications: Cross-contamination during washing process may increase the food safety risk of fresh produce. Many conventional antimicrobial treatments have limited efficacy, need constant replenishment, and pose a potential health concerns for the line workers. Therefore, new antimicrobial treatments are necessary. This study demonstrates the antimicrobial effect of a simultaneous UV-A light and propyl paraben treatment against Escherichia coli O157:H7 in water and its ability in reducing the risk of cross-contamination during washing of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves without negatively impairing its color, chlorophyll content, or total phenolic content. Majority of paraben residue on the spinach after the treatment could be effectively removed with a subsequent rinsing step making it less of an issue for consumers.

Foodborne pathogens if present on a product may transfer to the wash water and cross-contaminate other products immersed in the water.

This study aimed to compare the effects of two wash batch volumes – “low” (8 heads) and “high” (24 heads) on the efficacy of two commercial water antimicrobials and cross-contamination. Red leaf lettuce was spot-inoculated (~5.0 log CFU/g) with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes. In the first batch of washing, inoculated lettuce was washed with non-inoculated lettuce, followed by reuse of the water/antimicrobials twice washing only non-inoculated lettuce. Samples of inoculated and non-inoculated lettuce were collected to determine aerobic plate count (APC) as well as the populations of STEC and L. monocytogenes. Microbiological analysis of the wash water was also conducted. Wash volume (8 versus 24 lettuce heads) had limited effects on the antimicrobial activities of the interventions evaluated. Instead, high-volume wash increased the rate of cross-contamination between non-inoculated and inoculated lettuce, and cross-contamination of non-inoculated lettuce through wash water reuse. Retailers should consider volume of product processed per batch, reuse of wash water, and use of an appropriate water antimicrobial in consideration of mitigating potential product cross-contamination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) seedlings were cultivated in soil containing 700 mg kg-1 Cu and the leaves of seedlings were sprayed with different concentrations of IAA. Exogenous IAA treatment reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in Cu-stressed seedlings and increased biomass, proline content, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Exogenous IAA treatment also increased the levels of nitrogen (N) assimilation compounds and the activities of N-metabolizing enzymes, but reduced NH4+ content. Notably, lower concentrations of IAA (10-40 mg L-1) increased the Cu concentrations in roots and reduced the Cu concentrations in leaves, while higher concentrations of IAA (50 mg L-1) reduced the Cu concentrations in both roots and leaves to the lowest levels. The findings indicated that the application of IAA reduced Cu accumulation, alleviated Cu toxicity, and enhanced Cu tolerance in spinach seedlings. IAA application could be used as an alternative strategy for reducing Cu accumulation in vegetable crops and for remediating Cu-contaminated soil, in turn reducing the hazardous effects of heavy metal contamination on human health and the environment. © 2019 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Production of chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora) in greenhouses often requires intensive pesticide use, which raises serious concerns over food safety and human health. This study investigated uptake, translocation and residue dissipation of typical fungicides (metalaxyl-M and fludioxonil) and insecticides (cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam) in greenhouse chrysanthemum when applied in soils. Chrysanthemum plants could absorb these pesticides from soils via roots to various degrees, and bioconcentration factors (BCFLS) were positively correlated with lipophilicity (log Kow) of pesticides. Highly lipophilic fludioxonil (log Kow = 4.12) had the greatest BCFLS (2.96 ± 0.41 g g−1), whereas hydrophilic thiamethoxam (log Kow = −0.13) had the lowest (0.09 ± 0.03 g g−1). Translocation factors (TF) from roots to shoots followed the order of TFleaf &gt; TFstem &gt; TFflower. Metalaxyl-M and cyantraniliprole with medium lipophilicity (log Kow of 1.71 and 2.02, respectively) and hydrophilic thiamethoxam showed relatively strong translocation potentials with TF values in the range of 0.29–0.81, 0.36–2.74 and 0.30–1.03, respectively. Dissipation kinetics in chrysanthemum flowers followed the first-order with a half-life of 21.7, 5.5, 10.0 or 8.2 days for metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam, respectively. Final residues of these four pesticides, including clothianidin (a primary toxic metabolite of thiamethoxam), in all chrysanthemum flower samples were below the maximum residue limit (MRL) values 21 days after two soil applications each at the recommended dose (i.e., 3.2, 2.1, 4.3 and 4.3 kg ha−1, respectively). However, when doubling the recommended dose, the metabolite clothianidin remained at concentrations greater than the MRL, despite that thiamethoxam concentration was lower than the MRL value. This study provided valuable insights on the uptake and residues of metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam (including its metabolite clothianidin) in greenhouse chrysanthemum production, and could help better assess food safety risks of chrysanthemum contamination by parent pesticides and their metabolites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The potential of using hyperspectral imaging was evaluated for the rapid non-destructive prediction of pesticide residues. A new method was proposed to solve the problem of low recognition rate of abamectin low concentration residue on broccoli surface, which was using convolutional neural network (CNN) based on near-infrared hyperspectral data. The result showed that the highest accuracy rate reached 84.9% based on convolutional neural network, which is 10.1% higher than the accuracy of the model based on extreme learning machine model.

We evaluated protocols to recover Giardia spp. cysts in Brassica oleracea (cabbage) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) and then detection was performed by concentrating with formalin/ether solutions and microscopy or immunofluorescence or DNA amplification via PCR. To evaluate this methodology, G. duodenalis cysts were inoculated in triplicate (10 cysts) in 35-g samples of lettuce and cabbage. The method obtaining the highest percentage of recovery in cabbage was sulfamic acid solution plus stirring with stomacher (47.7% + 7.5). For lettuce, the best method was glycine solution plus stirring with stomacher (46.6% +/- 5.3). Inter-observer agreement was of 0.99. Giardia was detected by amplifying specific sequences for the DNA coding SSU rRNA. In 27 lettuce samples and 27 cabbage samples, obtained from supermarkets and street vendors, two lettuce samples (7.4%) and one cabbage sample (3.7%) were positive for Giardia via PCR assay and were sequenced, determining that they were two of assemblage B and one of lettuce to assemblage E. This method is proposed to detect Giardia in vegetables by PCR detection, enabling public health authorities to identify genotypes circulating in food, which will help to establish measures that reduce outbreaks of parasitic diseases associated with contaminated food.},

   abstract = {Background: The vegetables provide important nutrients to human beings. Nevertheless, contaminated vegetables can cause health problems because of their microbial load. The aim of this study was to assess the microbial quality of three main leafy vegetables cultivated and consumed at Porto-Novo in Republic of Benin. Methods: Totally, 36 samples of amaranth, nightshade, and lettuce were taken from three districts of Porto-Novo at urban gardening level. The samples were tested microbiologically according to international standards for determination of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, faecal streptococci, and Salmonella spp. The results were analyzed using SPSS software v. 16.0. Results: In total, aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts in leafy vegetables ranged from 4.42x105 to 1.08x106 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/g. The highest and lowest total coliform loads were found in lettuces (3.21x103 CFU/g) and the nightshades (1.78x102CFU/g), showing significant (p&lt;0.05) difference. Faecal streptococci load ranged from 1.01x103 to 3.18x103 CFU/g and was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in amaranths than in lettuces and nightshades. C. perfringens ranged from 0.633x101 to 1.18x101 CFU/g. Salmonella spp. was absent in all vegetables. Conclusion: High microbial contaminations were found in the three leafy vegetables in urban gardening at Porto-Novo, Benin. So, it is necessary to improve the microbial quality of leafy vegetables farmed at Porto-Novo for reduction of health risk in consumers. © 2019, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences.},

   abstract = {Prepackaged leafy green vegetables represent one of the fastest growing segments of the fresh-produce industry in the United States. Several steps in the production process have been mechanized to meet the downstream demand for prebagged lettuces. The growth in this market, however, has come with drawbacks, and chief among them are consumers finding wild animals in prepackaged crops. These incidents may signal an overburdened produce supply chain, but we currently lack the information needed to determine if this is a food-safety problem or food-quality concern. Here, we address this gap by reviewing online media coverage of wild vertebrates found in prepackaged produce items by customers in the United States. We discovered 40 independent incidents since 2003 with 95% having occurred during 2008–2018, suggesting that the frequency of incidents may have increased during the last decade. The minority of incidents included wild animals found in organic produce (27.5%), whereas the majority involved conventionally grown crops (72.5%). Most incidents involved amphibians (52.5%) and reptiles (22.5%), while fewer contained mammals (17.5%) and birds (7.5%). Frogs and toads made up all of the amphibian-related incidents, with more than 60% comprising small-bodied treefrogs found in various types of fresh leafy greens. At least seven incidents involved Pacific Treefrogs (Hyliola regilla) and three comprised Green Anoles (Anolis carolinensis). One lizard and nine frogs were found alive, and at least two frogs were released into non-native areas. This is the first review quantifying incidents of vertebrates found by customers in prepackaged produce, yet it remains unclear whether these occurrences indicate a food-safety crisis or a complaint against food quality. Nevertheless, wild animals can spread diseases to humans via contaminated produce, therefore we contend that industry professionals can reduce the potential health risk to their consumers and negative economic consequences to themselves through increased attention to this matter. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

During tea infusion with hot water pesticide residues in chrysanthemum flowers can be transferred into tea solution, posing potential health risks to consumers. Using greenhouse chrysanthemum this study systematically investigated the transfer of metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin (a major metabolite of thiamethoxam) from dry chrysanthemum flowers to tea solution at a range of infusion repetitions, duration and water temperature. The tested pesticides were released into tea solution at varying degrees, and the maximum transfer percentage was 59.9%, 9.8%, 29.4%, 88.2% and 68.4% for metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin, respectively. The transfer of pesticides into tea solution generally increased with increasing pesticide water solubility, water temperature, infusion duration, and pesticide concentrations in dry chrysanthemum flowers, but decreased with increasing octanol-water partition coefficient and the number of infusion repetitions. Risk quotient for pesticide intake via consuming tea solution of chrysanthemum flowers (one and two times of recommended pesticide dosages) ranged from <0.00003 to 0.0924, indicating a low health risk. This study provides useful information for risk assessment of pesticide residues in greenhouse chrysanthemum flowers and may help establish realistic maximum residue limit of pesticides in chrysanthemum flowers and tea solution. © 2019},

A field and pot experiment were conducted to investigate the growth and cadmium absorption of rice intercropped with water spinach under different moisture management schemes (continuous flooding, interval flooding, and 75% field capacity). In the field experiment, the concentration of Cd in the grain of rice was significantly lower in the intercropping system than that permitted by the National Food Safety Standard of China (GB 2762-2017). Furthermore, the land equivalent ratio (1.42) was higher in the rice-water spinach intercropping system, indicating a significant advantage of the intercropping system in yield. At the same time, the bio-concentration amount (BCA) of Cd of rice and water spinach in intercropping system significantly increased by 17.99% and 31.98%, respectively (P＜0.05). However, the metal removal equivalent ratio (MRER) of Cd was 1.34, which showed the intercropping system of rice-water spinach had advantage in Cd removal. In the pot experiment, the total iron plaque concentration on the root surface of rice and the pH of the rhizosphere soil were higher under continuous flooding (TCF) than under the control conditions (75% field capacity, TCK), which could significantly decrease the available Cd in the rhizosphere soil and the accumulation of Cd in rice organs. So, this study demonstrated that iron plaque can obstruct and decrease the Cd absorbed by rice in a rice-water spinach intercropping system combined with water management. The intercropping rice with water spinach can achieve the goal of remediation while producing for farmland contaminated by Cd. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Therefore, this study aimed to detect the parasitic contamination in some common raw vegetables in Baghdad, Iraq. Materials and Method: A cross sectional study conducted in Baghdad city for one year (from February 2012 till February 2013). Iodine staining of wet mount preparation was performed to identifying the enteric parasites in a 360 samples of leafy vegetables that commonly eating raw as salad. Results: 112 (31.1%) were positive samples for enteric parasites out of the 360 samples of leafy vegetables that was examined by this study.

The prevalence differed by sample type: E. faecalis and E faecium were the most or second most frequently identified species in foods of animal origin, while a large portion of the leafy vegetable isolates were confirmed as E. casseliflavus. The presence of virulence genes was apparent in all species except E. durans; approximately half of the isolates (46.3%) had more than one virulence determinant, especially gelE (gelatinase) (88.1%). One of the interesting findings was that even non-E. faecalis and non-E. faecium enterococci also had virulence determinants. However, none of the Enterococcus isolates were resistant to vancomycin. These results provide comprehensive data on the prevalence of the genus Enterococcus in South Korea and empirical evidence regarding the virulence potential; thus, the findings herein call for further studies about the relevance of these bacteria to food safety.},

The efficiency of coring tool design modifications in reducing bacterial transfer to lettuce heads was evaluated under simulated field operations. The standard coring tool consists of a stainless steel cylindrical tube welded to a tab that is inserted into a plastic handle. Design modifications included removal of the welded portion, incorporation of a shorter front straight bottom edge, or an angled bottom edge toward the front. In the first study, coring tools of four different designs were inoculated by dipping in a tryptic soy broth (TSB) suspension that contained 8.85 Log CFU/mL of Escherichia coli K-12 and then were used to core 100 lettuce heads, consecutively. Use of the standard tool resulted in 91% ± 9% positive lettuce heads. Removing the welded surface from the standard tool resulted in the highest reduction of E. coli transfer (44% ± 11.9% positive lettuce heads, P < 0.05), whereas incorporation of a short front straight edge with no welding resulted in 65.6% ± 5.6% of the cored lettuce heads being positive for E. coli. Removal of the welded surface resulted in a 40% decrease in E. coli contamination among the last 20 cored lettuce heads (81 to 100), which indicates that coring tool design modifications resulted in reduced cross-contamination. In the second study, the transfer of Salmonella to coring tools after their immersion in rinsing solutions was evaluated using imaging. The tools were dip inoculated for 2 min in water, water with lettuce extract, or TSB containing 7 Log CFU/mL bioluminescent Salmonella Newport; they were then imaged to observe spatial distribution of bacteria. There was greater retention and spatial distribution of Salmonella on the surface of tools immersed in water containing lettuce extract than in TSB and water. The results of the second study indicate that rinsing solutions that contain lettuce particulate and organic load could facilitate cross-contamination of Salmonella Newport to tool surfaces. © International Association for Food Protection.},

Increased metal accumulation in the soils may trigger competition between toxic metals and essential nutrients for absorption by plants and consequently leads to the development of oxidative stress. Soybean plants have a delicate system of defense mechanisms. We assume that the influence of heavy metals on plant growth as a whole can be traced through a change in the activity of enzymes. We studied the stress-reducing reaction against the toxic effects of copper sulphate and zinc sulphate, identified different endurance classes, and observed differences in the biochemical adaptation i.e. ribonuclease (RNase) activity in the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts. Sulphates of both zinc and copper at maximum permissible concentration and double maximum permissible concentration affected the multiple forms of RNase and its specific activity in the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts (grown for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days). Wild soybean sprouts had higher RNase activity as compared to cultivated soybean sprouts. It is shown that the limits of endurance for wild soybean during intoxication are observed on days 1, 3 and 5, while for cultivated soybean they vary depending on the type of toxicant and its concentration. Sulphates of copper and zinc affect the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts in a time and dose-dependent manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The study aimed to screen Cd low-enriched leafy vegetables and explore whether antioxidative enzymes and heavy metal chelators are synergistic defensive mechanisms. In this paper, the Cd accumulation and translocation of garland chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium L.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were examined by soil pot culture and hydroponic experiments. The responses of oxidative stress markers, antioxidative enzymes activity, and thiol pool (cysteine, γ-glutamylcysteine, glutathione, and phytochelatins) content to Cd stress were assayed. The results showed that Garland chrysanthemum was Cd low-uptake species. The soil Cd safety thresholds for spinach, lettuce, and garland chrysanthemum were 0.41, 0.49, and 9.10 mg kg –1 , respectively. The order of root phytochelatins (PCs) concentration was consistent with that of plant tolerance index (TI): garland chrysanthemum &gt; spinach &gt; lettuce. While the order of the ratio of shoot Cd to root Cd (SR ratio) was exactly the opposite of that of TI. In lettuce root, activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase decreased significantly under Cd stress. Nevertheless those parameters in the roots of spinach and lettuce maintained steady, or even enhanced. In conclusion, the Cd translocation and partition in plant, antioxidative defense, and PCs homeostasis played an important role in the Cd tolerance of vegetables. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

A previous study of our laboratory revealed poor microbial quality of, and presence of Salmonella on, leafy green vegetables grown or sold in Accra, Ghana. The aims of this study were to determine agricultural practices of urban vegetable farmers and the association between agricultural practices and microbial safety of vegetables produced. A survey was conducted among 102 farmers from 12 farming areas who produced exotic and indigenous leafy greens in Accra, Ghana to identify their farming practices. It was observed that water from waste drains pumped into shallow wells was used for irrigation by 70% of the farmers. Incompletely composted manure was commonly used (99%) in farming. Vegetables were usually harvested using bare hands (96%) and knives (73%) and transported mainly in sacks (94%) to market centers under non-refrigerated conditions. Over 60% of the farmers disagreed that the use of polluted irrigation water can contaminate vegetables or make consumers sick. According to the seemingly unrelated regression model, farmers with no formal education and less food safety knowledge and had been planting on their current farmlands for several years were likely to produced vegetables with higher fecal coliform and Enterococcus sp. counts compared to other farmers. Vegetables cultivated by farmers who disagreed that the use of contaminated water can make consumers sick were associated with the production of vegetables with high fecal coliform and Enterococcus sp. counts. Education and improved agricultural and post-harvest handling practices should be encouraged among vegetable producers in the area to improve food safety. © 2020 by the authors.

The use of acetic fermented as antibacterial could be a skillful mechanism to improve the quality and safety of this food. Objective: To evaluate the microbiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) salads marketed in the city of Duque de Caxias, RJ and the effectiveness of acetic acid lecithin as a decontaminant Method: Lettuce salad samples were collected at four restaurants and analyzed before and after decontamination with acetic fermented in volatile acidity (4, 5 and 6 in g. 100 mL(-1)) and concentrations of 10% and 50% the count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, total and thermotolerant coliforms and the presence of Salmonella spp. Results: The analyses revealed poor quality of the samples in three restaurants (A, B, C) where, although the presence of Salmonella spp. was not observed, there were high counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and total and thermotolerant coliforms. In accordance with legal regulations, in two establishments, the samples would be disapprove by the excess of thermotolerant coliforms. With the use of acetic fermentation in the decontamination, bacterial counts were reduced, allowing all the samples to present satisfactory conditions for human consumption. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the treatments with different concentrations and acidity of acetic fermented in relation to the untreated samples. Conclusions: Acetic fermented can be a safe and practical alternative to improve the hygienic-sanitary quality of lettuce in raw salads, ensuring food safety and reducing risks to human health.},

As an alternative, non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure could be a versatile tool. Therefore, a pilot-scaled set-up based on a microwave-plasma source that generates plasma processed air (PPA), a gaseous mixture which contains manifold RNS-based chemical compounds gaining, among others, the antimicrobial effectivity of that mixture. The PPA was introduced to a water-processing device (WPD) to enrich tap water. By this way, plasma processed tap water (PPtW), which can be applied for the decontamination of packaging material, fresh produce and processing equipment, was generated. This is a new and innovative method for the generation of antimicrobial active plasma processed water. In our experiments, the native contamination of fresh-cut lettuce treated with PPtW in a common washing process and the microbial load of the washing water itself was investigated. Different treatment scenarios showed the influence of PPtW to the fresh-cut lettuce and the washing water as well as the hygienic problems of recontamination during the washing process. The characteristics of plasma and its generated cocktail of long living chemical compounds in air and in water leading to a significant bacterial inactivation and offering a wide range of possible applications. Industrial relevance: The safety, quality and shelf life of freshly cut vegetables greatly depend on the microbial load, especially with phyto and human pathogens, of the produce as well as the hygienic design of production device and good handling and production practice. This study shows that the application of PPW/PPtW, as a promising non-thermal sanitation technology, enables the inactivation of native contamination on fresh-cut lettuce in industrial relevant level. It further describes the impact of the necessity of hygienic environment during production to avoid cross- and re-contamination. The results contribute to the understanding and product-specificity of PPW-induced effects on safety, quality and shelf life of fresh cut lettuce and could be a basis for a possible industrial implementation and complement of common technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A total of 288 vegetable samples (cabbage, lettuce and Chinese cabbage) were collected from March to August 2018 in the wet market and supermarkets of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. Results showed that 116 out of 288 (40.28%) vegetable samples were positive of food-borne parasites such as Ascaris sp., Hymenolepis diminuta, Isospora sp., Hookworm/Strongylid sp./free-living nematode larvae, Strongylid sp. egg, Taenia sp., and Trichuris sp. Isospora sp. has the highest contamination rate (16.67%) and mean density (13 eggs/g) from the sampled vegetables. Possible sources of these identified parasites are contaminated soil and water harbored by the sampled vegetables during cultivation, transport and handling/preparation by vendors.

However, improper handling increases the potential for serious environmental contamination and resource waste. The preparation of nutrient solutions for hydroponic lettuce production requires large amounts of mineral fertilizers, which provides an opportunity for poultry biogas slurry to enter the crop nutrient cycle. To assess the feasibility of the application of poultry biogas slurry, we used different proportions of biogas slurry and mineral fertilizers in a hydroponics experiment with lettuce. Four treatments were established: HS (half-strength Hoagland solution), BS (2.6% biogas slurry), BS+HS (1.3% biogas slurry+quarter-strength Hoagland solution), and BS+MF (2.6% biogas slurry+mineral fertilizers). The addition of poultry biogas slurry (BS+HS) did not have an adverse effect on lettuce growth, significantly increased the soluble sugar concentration, reduced the nitrate concentration, and the concentrations of heavy metals were still within the safety standards. In addition, the application of poultry biogas slurry could effectively reduce the production costs, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions of hydroponically grown lettuce. Based on our study, poultry biogas slurry could replace 50% of the mineral fertilizer used in hydroponic lettuce production. The key is to control the electrical conductivity and replenish the nutrients that are lacking in the biogas slurry, especially magnesium.},

After being treated with PAW for 30 min, the populations of total aerobic bacteria and total yeasts and moulds on mung bean sprouts were decreased by 2.32- and 2.84- log10 CFU/g, respectively. The PAW treatment had no significant effect on the antioxidant potential of mung bean sprouts as shown by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH•) scavenging activity assay, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) method, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay (p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, the PAW treatment caused no significant changes in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, nor the sensory characteristics of mung bean sprouts (p &gt; 0.05). Reactive species such as nitrates, nitrites, and H2O2 were generated in PAW, which presumably contributed to the disinfection efficacy of PAW. These data show that PAW can be used as a promising nonthermal technology for the control of microbial contamination in sprouts. Industrial relevance: Edible sprouts are common food ingredients across the world. However, sprouts can be contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms, which may result in health risks to humans. Recently, PAW has been shown to be a safe and effective method for food surface sanitation. However, the application of PAW in the microbial control for sprouts is less investigated. In this study, the influences of PAW on the microbial load, chemical and sensory quality of mung bean sprouts were investigated for the first time. The results showed that PAW could effectively inactivate bacteria and yeasts and moulds on mung bean sprouts without resulting in significant changes in the antioxidant capacities, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and sensory characteristics of mung bean sprouts.

A total of 216 samples of ready-to-eat salads from the Cypriot market were analysed to determine the microbiological quality and safety, along with physicochemical attributes of the salads and identify possible correlations between them. The samples were randomly collected from four retail outlets and correspond to five different salad producing companies. Furthermore, the effects of season, salad producer and type of salad and/or their interactions with the tested parameters were investigated. The results revealed that the higher microbial load among seasons was observed in samples collected during spring. Escherichia coli was found in 11.57% of samples and 2.62% of isolates were found to be able to produce extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). All samples were found negative for Salmonella enterica, whereas Listeria monocytogenes was present in 3.70% of samples. Higher levels of spoilage bacteria (lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp.) were detected during winter and spring. Additionally, the %CO2 production was affected by the type of salad, while the interaction between producer and type of salad, affected total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of samples. A positive correlation of phenols and antioxidants with the presence of Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., E. coli and Bacillus cereus was observed, suggesting that excessive handling increases microbial load and plant stress. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {There is robust epidemiological evidence for the beneficial effects of broccoli consumption on health, many of them clearly mediated by the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. Present in the plant as its precursor, glucoraphanin, sulforaphane is formed through the actions of myrosinase, a beta-thioglucosidase present in either the plant tissue or the mammalian microbiome. Since first isolated from broccoli and demonstrated to have cancer chemoprotective properties in rats in the early 1990s, over 3000 publications have described its efficacy in rodent disease models, underlying mechanisms of action or, to date, over 50 clinical trials examining pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease mitigation. This review evaluates the current state of knowledge regarding the relationships between formulation (e.g., plants, sprouts, beverages, supplements), bioavailability and efficacy, and the doses of glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane that have been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. We pay special attention to the challenges for better integration of animal model and clinical studies, particularly with regard to selection of dose and route of administration. More effort is required to elucidate underlying mechanisms of action and to develop and validate biomarkers of pharmacodynamic action in humans. A sobering lesson is that changes in approach will be required to implement a public health paradigm for dispensing benefit across all spectrums of the global population.},
