The aim of present study was: • to systematically review about Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd) and Nickel (Ni) concentrations in cultivated rice in Iran and; • to estimate the non-carcinogenic risk for age and sex groups. We applied the target hazard quotient (THQ) and total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) to evaluation of the non-carcinogenic risk. International and Iranian databases were searched from January 2008 to October 2016. Data obtained from 27 articles showed that minimum and maximum concentrations of heavy metals were As (0.05 ± 0.09 μg/g dry weight) and Ni (0.83 ± 0.04 μg/g dry weight), respectively. The rank order of heavy metals based on THQ was As > Cr > Pb > Cd > Ni. Also the rank order of consumers rice based on TTHQ were rural females (0.49) > urban females (0.461) > rural males (0.455) > urban males (0.41). Minimum and maximum of TTHQ was related to 35–44 and 15–24 years age groups both males and females, respectively. Since THQ and TTHQ were either lower than 1 value, therefore, consumers were not exposed to carcinogenic risk by consumption of rice cultivated in Iran. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {Beer, a beverage consumed throughout the world, is mainly derived from cereals. In this study, fungal and mycotoxin contamination, as well as the physicochemical properties of maize-based opaque beer (umqombothi) obtained from the Gauteng province of South Africa, was investigated. The mean water activity, pH and total titratable acidity of the analysed beer samples were 0.91, 3.76 and 1.20% lactic acid, respectively. The investigation revealed Aspergillus, Penicillium, Phoma and Saccharomyces as the predominant fungal genera with a mean fungal load of 3.66 × 105 CFU/mL. Among the mycotoxigenic fungal species recovered, Aspergillus flavus had the highest incidence of 26%. Previously unreported strains such as P. chrysogenum strain AD25, A. sydowii strain AD 22 and A. tritici strain AD 11 were found. Furthermore, mycotoxin quantitative analysis via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometry showed that deoxynivalenol was the dominant mycotoxin occurring in 84% of the samples. This was followed by enniatin B that occurred in 75% of samples ranging from 12 to 44 μg/L and fumonisin B1 (FB1) (incidence of 53% at a maximum level of 182 μg/L). Generally, there was low occurrence aflatoxins, whereas T-2, HT-2, nivalenol, zearalenone, 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol were not detected. All the samples analysed had safe levels of mycotoxins tested but were contaminated by at least two mycotoxins that could pose some additive or synergistic health effects among consumers. On average: a 60 kg adult consuming 1–6 L/day of the beer was exposed to FB1 + FB2 at an estimated 2.20–13.20 μg/kg body weight/day. These values were far above the maximum tolerable daily intake of 2 μg/kg bw/day established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The study demonstrates that consumption of umqombothi can significantly enhance dietary exposure to multiple mycotoxins among consumers, and therefore accentuates the need for strategies aimed at reducing toxigenic fungal colonization and mycotoxin contamination in the beer processing chain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study fumonisin B-1 (FB1) and aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) analysis were conducted on symptomless and rotten maize harvested at different harvest time points after physiological maturity (HTPAPM). Fusarium verticillioides dominated at all HTPAPM. Other fungi reported include Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus and Sternocarpella maydis. In 2001, FB1 levels in symptomless maize ranged between 22 to 1348 mu g/kg. Mean FB1 levels at 4, 8, and 12 weeks HTPAPM for Malava were 56, 80 and 317 mu g/kg respectively. In Tongaren during 2001 mean FB1 levels of 41, 179 and 590 mu g/kg were recorded at 4, 8, 12 week HTPAPM respectively. The FB1 levels in rotten maize ranged from 39 to >5000 mu g/kg and increased with HTPAPM. The highest AFB(1) level was 17 mu g/kg in rotten maize. The results suggest that delayed harvesting could increase FB1 contamination in maize.},

   abstract = {Background: The goal of this study has been to evaluate the extent of mycotoxins contamination and their co-occurrence in wheat grain intended for animal feed. A total of 52 wheat samples were collected from the harvest of two consecutive years (2010, 2011) from two counties (Timis and Arad) located in Western Romania and the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZON) and fumonisins (FUMO) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In order to evaluate the toxicological impact of mycotoxins, naturally contaminated wheat samples were administered in rats feed for one month. Results: The mycotoxin with the highest incidence in wheat samples was DON due to agro-climatic conditions typical for the west part of Romania. DON was found in 73.08% of samples harvested in 2010 and the highest level of contamination was 3390 ppb. The incidence of DON in sample from 2011 was lower than those of 2010, with a frequency of occurrence of 19.23%. The occurrence of ZON was in the range 69.23-76.92%, with an average value of 187.74 ppb. The OTA content in wheat was below the maximum tolerable limit established by EU Commission regulation for feed legislation (250 ppb). For FUMO the lowest percentage of positive samples was registered (15.38% in wheat sample harvested in 2010 and 11.54% positive samples in 2011). With respect to the co-occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins, the results proved that ZON was found as a co-contaminant together with DON, especially when climatic conditions for development of fungus are favorable (high air humidity). The differences recorded between investigated localities and their classifications according to the mycotoxin kind and year of harvest were carried out by principal components analysis (PCA). The histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation performed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining technique as well as by assessing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) revealed significant modification of kidney, liver and spleen cells in the case of DON and FUMO. In terms of toxicity induced by OTA and ZON it was highlighted mixed normal and necrotic areas in liver, while histological assessment revealed normal VEGF expression in kidneys. Conclusions: Although none of the analyzed samples exceeding the stipulated maximum limits for cereals used as feed, a high incidence of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species have been recorded (DON and ZON) in wheat samples harvested in Western Romania. Also, histopathological evaluation revealed significant tissue lesions in liver and kidney of rats after one month of feeding with natural contaminated wheat.},

   abstract = {Citrinin (CIT) and ochratoxin A (OTA) are nephrotoxic mycotoxins, produced by several Aspergillus and Penicillium species and their co-occurrence in rice may cause health effects in humans. Rice is an important food crop worldwide and is a major staple food in Asia which may be invaded by CIT and OTA producing fungal spores in the field, during harvest and storage. Humans are exposed to these mycotoxins through ingestion of contaminated rice and other food commodities. Yet, data on the combined presence to these food contaminants are still insufficient to estimate human exposure in Asia. This review describes the prevalence of CIT and OTA in rice in Asia and its implications on human health, which may help in establishing and carrying out proper management strategies against mould development on rice. From the health point of view, combined exposition of CIT and OTA should be a public concern as both are nephrotoxic and long-term exposure can pose detrimental health effects. Thus, it is necessary for local farmers and food factories to implement strict measures and to improve methods for rice preservation during the distribution to consumers, particularly in the markets. Moreover, regular surveys for CIT and OTA occurrence in rice and human biomonitoring are recommended to reduce the health effects in Asian population. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {Cereals are arguably the single most significant source of food for man and his animals. Consequently, even low levels of chemical contamination can have significance in terms of consumer health. Chemical contamination of cereals can arise both when the crop is produced and/or when it is processed. In terms of contaminants of the crop itself, these can either be a consequence of natural phenomena (e.g., heavy metals and mycotoxins) or by the direct actions of man himself (e.g., pesticides). However, even if a consequence of natural phenomena, the presence of contaminants can often be aggravated or mitigated by agronomic and subsequent processing practices. A similar situation can arise during food manufacture with contaminants actually being formed during certain cooking processes (e.g., acrylamide) or due to deliberate actions (e.g., use of a nonpermitted additive). As in the case of those contaminants associated with the crop, food manufacturing practices can therefore either ameliorate or enhance the levels of contaminants seen. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Chemical contamination of cereals can arise when the crop is produced and/or when it is processed. Contamination of the crop itself can be due to either natural phenomena (e.g. heavy metals and mycotoxins) or direct human action (e.g. pesticides). However, even naturally occurring contaminants can be affected by agronomic and processing practices. Similarly, during food manufacture contaminants can be formed by cooking processes (e.g. acrylamide) or due to deliberate actions (e.g. use of a non-permitted additive). Food manufacturing practices can also therefore affect the levels of contaminants seen. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Cereals are a significant food-source for man and his animals and, as such, are extensively traded on the international market. Given the quantities consumed, even low levels of chemical contamination can have significance both in terms of consumer health and the agri-food economy. In terms of the food-safety aspects of cereals and their products, considerable attention has been paid to the role of chemical contaminants. These can arise both during cultivation and/or when cereals are processed. Contamination can arise as a consequence of natural phenomena (e.g. heavy metals and mycotoxins) or by the direct actions of man himself (e.g. pesticides and food process toxicants). However, even where natural phenomena are the direct cause, the presence of the resulting contaminants can be aggravated or mitigated by agronomic and/or subsequent processing practices. In terms of assuring consumer safety, these issues are being addressed as part of the ongoing development of an international consensus on food-safety in terms of good agricultural and manufacturing practices as well as through the evolution of regulatory limits and codes of practice to achieve them. © 2014 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {The levels of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, methylmercury and arsenic) were determined in 37 brands of imported rice commonly consumed in Saudi Arabia after soaking and rinsing with water, and their potential health risks to residents were estimated by three indices: hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI) and cancer risk (CR). The mean levels of lead, cadmium, methylmercury and total arsenic in soaked (rinsed) rice grains were 0.034 (0.057), 0.015 (0.027), 0.004 (0.007) and 0.202 (0.183) μg/g dry weight, respectively. Soaking or rinsing rice grains with water decreased lead and cadmium levels in all brands to safe levels. All brands had total arsenic above the acceptable regulatory limits, irrespective of soaking or rinsing, and eight soaked and 12 rinsed brands contained methylmercury. The levels of all heavy metals except cadmium were above the acceptable regulatory limits when the rice was neither rinsed nor soaked. Weekly intakes of lead, cadmium, methylmercury and total arsenic from soaked (rinsed) grains were 0.638 (1.068), 0.279 (0.503), 0.271 (0.309) and 3.769 (3.407) μg/kg body weight (bw). The weekly intakes of lead and methylmercury from the consumption of one rinsed and two soaked rice brands respectively, exceeded the Provisional Tolerance Weekly Intake set by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The weekly intake of total arsenic for all brands was above the lowest benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL01) level of 0.3 μg/kg bw/d for an increased cancer risk set by European Food Safety Authority. Either soaking or rinsing grains before consumption can minimize the non-carcinogenic health risks to residents from cadmium and lead (HQ &lt; 1). Our local consumers, though, may experience health consequences from rice contaminated mainly with arsenic (HQ &gt; 1 all brands) and to a lesser extent with methylmercury (HQ &gt; 1 in 4 brands), even when soaked or rinsed with water before consumption. The combined non-carcinogenic effect of all metals expressed as HI was &gt;1, including soaked or rinsed rice, with total arsenic the major contributor followed by methylmercury. CR for total arsenic, whether consuming soaked, rinsed, un-soaked or unrinsed grains, exceeded the acceptable level of 10−4. Long-term consumption of rice contaminated with heavy metals, particularly arsenic, can pose potential health risks to the local population, especially vulnerable groups (pregnant women, children, elderly and patients). More attention should thus be given to contaminated rice and preventive measures should be taken. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

Because the toxicity of arsenic is dependent on its chemical form and that it may be in a form that is not bio-accessible (i.e. dissolved in the gastrointestinal tract) and can thus not become bio-available (i.e. end up in the blood stream, where it may exert its toxic effect), the bio-accessibility of arsenic was determined in thirteen different types of rice. The effects of washing and cooking were also studied. The total concentration of arsenic ranged from 93 to 989 µg kg−1 and its bio-accessibility ranged from 16 to 93%. Cooking only changed arsenic speciation in a few cases. However, simply washing rice with arsenic-free water before cooking removed 3–43% of the arsenic, resulting in all the rice tested except the most contaminated one being safe to consume by adults. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins (AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), AFG(2)), genotoxic mycotoxins, in raw maize, rice, sorghum and wheat samples collected since the year 2000 was evaluated using published data and occurrence data from the GEMS/Food database (https://extranet.who.int/gemsfood). Dietary risk assessments were conducted using GEMS/Food total aflatoxin occurrence and food consumption data obtained from the 17 Cluster Diets. Risk characterisation arising from aflatoxin exposure was conducted using both cancer risk and margin of exposure (MOE) approaches. A total of 89 publications were retrieved from the literature, reporting data related to 18,097 samples, of which 37.6% were positive for at least one aflatoxin. The total upper bound (UB) mean for all samples analysed was 13.6 mu g/kg, and was higher for rice (24.6 mu g/kg) and sorghum (25.9 mu g/kg). Of data related to the analysis of 4,536 samples reported to GEMS/Food database, 12.7% were positive for at least one aflatoxin. The total UB mean was 1.9 mu g/kg, and was higher for rice (2.4 mu g/kg) and maize (1.6 mu g/kg). Total intakes ranged from 3.0 ng/kg bw/day (Cluster C11) to 17.1 ng/kg bw/day (Cluster C09). On average, the consumption of rice contributed to 41.6% of the total aflatoxin intake in all clusters, followed by wheat (35.4%), maize (21.2%) and sorghum (1.8%). The lowest cancer risk was found in cluster C11 (0.057 cancers/year/10(5) individuals), and the highest in cluster C09 (0.467 cancers/year/10(5) individuals). MOE ranged from 56 (C11) to 10 (C09), indicating a potential risk to consumers. These results highlight the need for continuous action by health authorities to decrease aflatoxin contamination in cereals, as they are staple foods in diets worldwide. These actions include the enforcement of code of practices at the national level and the establishment of maximum contamination levels by the Codex System.},

   abstract = {Contents of 11 trichothecenes of A and B types and zearalenone were determined in corn (Zea mays) samples by using a high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The lowest LOD was found for T-2 triol with 0.2. μg/kg. The content of mycotoxins in corn grain was compared, depending on cultivar and storage space. Based on the results, it was found that the 12 different corn cultivars and mix contained 9 of the 12 mycotoxins under investigation. The mycotoxins found were deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, fusarenon X, neosolaniol, diacetoxyscirpenol, T-2 triol and zearalenone; T-2 tetraol, HT-2 and T-2 were not detected. DON was found to be a prevailing toxin of the highest concentration in almost all the studied samples. The most contaminated corn cultivar was Terada. Additional studies have shown differences in mycotoxins content in Delitop cultivar depending on the sample provider. This work presents the first complete and accurate survey carried out in Lower Silesia (southwestern Poland) on the presence of mycotoxins in corn and demonstrates how the examined region could be considered as suitable for the production of healthful corn products. © 2013.},

Four main anthocyanins, i.e., delphinidin 3-galactoside, delphinidin 3-arabinoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside were identified in Chakhao Poireiton while three main anthocyanins, delphinidin 3-galactoside, delphinidin 3-arabinoside and cyanidin 3-galactoside were identified in Chakhao Amubi. In both the cultivars, delphinidin 3-galactoside is the most predominant anthocyanin. The total monomeric anthocyanin content and total phenolics were measured using a modified pH differential method and modified Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. The total anthocyanin content in Chakhao Poireiton was found to be 740 mg/kg and Chakhao Amubi was 692 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside/kg of dried powder sample. And the total phenolic content was 577 and 500 mg/100 g of the dried powder sample as Gallic acid equivalent in Chakhao Poireiton and Chakhao Amubi, respectively. The anthocyanin extract showed strong antioxidant activity by DPPH assay, the highest scavenging activity of Chakhao Poireiton and Chakhao Amubi were 70.28 % and 69.73 %, respectively. From the study it can be suggested that supplementation of the black scented rice in the diet will have a great impact on human health.

Processed cereal-based foods are among the first solid foods eaten by "children, a particularly vulnerable population group. There is a lack of knowledge related to the co-occurrence of PAT and OTA in food intended for children consumption and their potential interactions during the digestion process. The present study aims to evaluate, for the first time, the co-occurrence of PAT and OTA in processed cereal-based foods for children consumption, the bioaccessibility of these two mycotoxins, and the contribution of the bioaccessibility data for human health risk assessment. PAT and OTA incidence were 75% and 50%, respectively. These mycotoxins co-occurred in 40% of analysed samples. Bioaccessibility assays revealed mean values of 52% and 56% for PAT, alone and combined with OTA; and 100% and 106% for OTA, alone and combined with PAT. Considering the human health risk assessment, and taking into account the co-occurrence and the bioaccessibility results, this study indicates a tolerable exposure to these mycotoxins representing a low risk for Portuguese children. The present work reinforces the importance of a holistic approach for risk assessment which gathers data from occurrence, exposure and bioaccessibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of water activity, temperature, incubation time and their interactions on growth, lag phase and OTA production by two strains belonging to A. niger aggregate in irradiated corn grains. This study shows that OTA production on corn grains occurs within a more restricted range of water activity and temperature than fungal growth. This point is important in order to maintain the appropriate conditions in stored corn that prevent toxigenic fungal growth and thus OTA production. Irradiated corn grains were re-hydrated to 0.910-0.995 of aW with sterile distillate water. The temperatures assayed were 15, 25 and 30 °C. Growth assessment was made every day during the incubation period (21 days) to calculate the growth rate, lag phase and the OTA production at 7, 14 and 21 days. Both strains showed optimum growth at 30 °C at 0.951 aW. Ochratoxin A production occurred over a range of temperatures (15-30 °C) with optimum production at 25 °C depending on aW assayed. Maximum OTA production was obtained for both strains at 0.973 aW. The results obtained suggest that the storage of corn grains at water activities lower than 0.951 and 15 °C should prevent these fungal species growth and OTA production during 21 days approximately. © 2008.},

Total Dermal Exposure (TDE) of chlorpyrifos among the median exposed and the 5% highly exposed groups during a spray event were 24 mg and 48 mg, respectively. When these were converted as a percentage of the quantity of active ingredient applied (Unit Exposure, UE), UE values of 0.03% and 0.06% were found among the median exposed and the 5% highly exposed groups, respectively. Overall, the hands were the most contaminated anatomical regions of the applicators, both in terms of proportion of TDE (39%) and skin loading (13 g/cm(2)). Also, the lower anatomical region was more contaminated (82% of TDE) compared to the upper anatomical region (18% of TDE). The levels of chlorpyrifos TDE among the applicators were found to be influenced by the quantity of insecticide applied and the height of the crops sprayed (p < 0.05). The pesticide UE data of the present study can be used to estimate the levels of dermal exposure under similar pesticide use scenarios among applicators. The findings of the present study suggest that protecting the hands and the lower anatomical regions with appropriate PPE may significantly reduce exposure among applicators. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Generally, there is limited information on pesticide absorbed dose levels and health risk attributable to the dermal route of exposure among applicators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the absorbed dose levels and consequent health risk from dermal exposure to chlorpyrifos among applicators on rice farms in Ghana. The whole-body dosimetry technique was used to capture chlorpyrifos residues penetrating the applicators' clothing and reaching their skin, as well as residues reaching uncovered body areas of the applicators. Acute (ADD(D)) and chronic (LADD(D)) absorbed dose levels of chlorpyrifos were estimated from the residues and plotted as cumulative probability distributions. Health risk from chlorpyrifos exposure was characterized using the Hazard Quotient (HQ) technique. Three of the four acute exposure guideline values used in the study indicated that applicators, represented by the median-exposed (ADD(D), 15 mu g/kg/day) and the 5% - highly exposed (ADD(D), 27 mu g/kg/day) groups were at high risk of acute adverse health effects due to chlorpyrifos exposure, with HQ values ranging from 1.5 to 5 and 2.7 to 9, respectively. Regarding chronic adverse health effects, none of the guideline values suggested risk among the median-exposed group (LADD(D), 0.3 mu g/kg/day), with HQ values ranging from 0.03 to 1. However, two of the chronic exposure guideline values suggested that the 5%- highly exposed group (LADD(D), 0.6 mu g/kg/day) may be adversely affected, with HQ values ranging from 1.2 to 2. These findings highlight the importance of the dermal route as a major pesticide exposure pathway and suggest possible exposure minimization strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The dynamics of Fusarium and fumonisins in maize grains stored in traditional structures (Granary. Mudsilo and Tua) commonly used in Uganda were investigated. The storage structures were constructed using locally available materials following the procedures used by farmers. Maize was stored in both shelled and unshelled form. Moisture and insect damage were also monitored. Moisture content of the maize grains in all the storage structures decreased from an average of 19.2% to <14% within two months. The maize weevil (Stophilus zeamais) was the major cause of grain damage. Fusarium incidence in all the structures increased from an average of 61.9-77.5% in the first 2 months of storage and thereafter significantly decreased (p < 0.05) to 31.9% by the sixth month. The storage structures did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) Fusarium incidence at each sampling stage. Fumonisin levels in all the storage structures decreased over the storage period from an average of 5.7 to 2.8 mg kg(-1). After 6 months, maize grains from the Granary had significantly lower (p < 0.001) fumonisin levels (1.61 mg kg(-1)) compared to that from Tua (3.4 mg kg(-1)) and Mudsilo (3.5 mg kg(-1)). These findings present an affordable handling practice for reducing the health hazards associated with fumonisin exposure amongst maize consumers. Good maintenance of storage structures to ensure that the moisture content of the grains remains below 14% throughout the storage period is emphasized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to OTA's toxicity and its effects on human's health, the authors performed this study to analyze the OTA's contamination levels in rice samples that gathered in different cities of Mazandaran (a province in northern Iran). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 80 rice samples were collected from several cities of Mazandaran. Data were analyzed using CD-ELISA method for OTA. Conjugated enzyme was added to uncoated-antibody wells and standard solution and sample extract were added to it. Solutions were transferred to the coated-antibody wells. Then, substrate was added to produce blue color. Finally, stopping solution was added to stop the reaction. The color intensity was inversely proportional to the OTA concentration, measured with the ELISA reader and calculated by analysis of variance by using the SPSS software package. Findings: None of the samples that were collected in Mazandaran were contaminated with >5 μg/kg of OTA in October. Also none of the samples from Amol, Fereydonkenar, Babol or Behshahr were contaminated with >5 μg/kg of this toxin in November. But in sari, Nowshahr and Ramsar the authors encountered samples that had >5 μg/kg of OTA contamination which is more than the acceptable limit. Practical implications: Screening and analyzing the rice fields are vital to detect any OTA contamination and can be effective for removing the contaminated rice. So proper strategies and management tactics are required in order to prevent OTA production in rice fields in pre- and post-harvest time and people must share their experiences regarding fighting this contamination. Originality/value: Since rice is used extensively all over the world, consumption of contaminated rice causes diseases for humans. Therefore, determination, management, and prevention of OTA should be considered seriously. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we demonstrate the application of our recently developed real-time immunoquantitative PCR (RT iq-PCR) assay for sensitive detection and quantification of aflatoxins in poultry feed, two types of dairy feed (1 and 2), horse feed, whole kernel corn feed grains, and retail yellow ground corn meal. Upon testing methanol/water (60:40) extractions of the above samples using competitive direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, the aflatoxin content was found to be <20 μg/kg. The RT iq-PCR assay exhibited high antigen hook effect in samples containing aflatoxin levels higher than the quantification limits (0.1–10 μg/kg), addressed by comparing the quantification results of undiluted and diluted extracts. In testing the reliability of the immuno-PCR assay, samples were spiked with 200 μg/kg of aflatoxin B1, but the recovery of spiked aflatoxin was found to be poor. Considering the significance of determining trace levels of aflatoxins and their serious implications for animal and human health, the RT iq-PCR method described in this study can be useful for quantifying low natural aflatoxin levels in complex matrices of food or animal feed samples without the requirement of extra sample cleanup. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Rice bran oil contains beneficial compounds that contribute to its resistance to oxidation, as well as the health of consumers. However, concerns have surfaced in recent years related to the heavy metal content of rice and rice-derived products. Rice is known to take up arsenic at a higher rate than other grain crops. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization recently set an acceptable limit of 0.2μg/g of arsenic in rice, but no limits have been set for other edible products such as rice bran oil. Furthermore, arsenic levels in rice bran oil have not been thoroughly investigated. In this work we characterized both crude and refined rice bran oils, including detailed chemical composition, analysis of bioactive lipids, and a multi-faceted approach for assessing prior oxidative history and stability of rice bran oils. We also analyzed levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc. Metal concentrations were verified through two independent analytical laboratories. Concentrations of lead and cadmium in rice bran oils were generally low. Zinc concentrations were detectable but low relative to daily dietary allowances. Arsenic and mercury concentrations differed between the methods used to collect the data. We explore in this work the origins of these differences. Practical applications: Rice absorbs arsenic at a high rate relative to other crops, which has lead to increased consumer concern regarding toxic metal contaminants in rice and rice products. Despite the recent interest in this topic and limited work by the US FDA to test arsenic levels in rice, metal concentrations in rice bran oils have remained unexplored. In this work, we offer a complete characterization of crude and refined rice bran oils, including analysis of arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc. This work explores the utility of different ICP methods for heavy metals analysis, and the work described here may provide context for much of the recent press surrounding metal contaminants in rice. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ergosterol was analysed by HPLC with UV-detection, ZEA by HPLC with fluorescence and UV-detection, while trichothecenes were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Ergosterol was detected in 105 of the 106 samples at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 24.2μgg-1. ZEA was found in 4 out of 69 samples at 2-13μgkg-1. Out of the 32 samples analysed for trichothecenes, only one sample was contaminated with 15-monoacetoxyscirpenol (15-MAS) at 4μgkg-1, and two samples were contaminated with T-2 tetraol at levels of 73 and 280μgkg-1. Nivalenol (NIV), scirpentriol (SCIRP), deoxynivalenol (DON), fusarenon-X (FUS-X), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), T-2 triol, neosolaniol (NEO), 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol (4,15-DAS), HT-2 and T-2 toxins (HT-2, T-2) were not detected in any of the samples. Thus in spite of the limited number of samples investigated, it seems to be obvious that zearalenone and trichothecene toxins do not appear to be major contaminants of Nigerian maize. The significantly higher ergosterol levels in maize that had been stored for 9 months compared with those of maize that had been stored for 4 months or less, point to the inadequacy of currently used storage methods in preventing deterioration. This is the first report of ergosterol levels in Nigerian maize. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {A newly developed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of the tremorgenic indole-diterpene alkaloid paxilline (PAX) and closely related analogs was used to analyze ergot sclerotia collected from rye and barley fields. The mean EIA standard curve detection limit was 0.47 ± 0.14 ng/mL; relative cross-reactivity of toxin standard solutions was found for 11-hydroxy-paspaline (terpendole E, 1.1%) but not for lolitrem B or ergot alkaloids. Sclerotia from all fields were positive in the PAX-EIA at concentration levels of 620 ± 200 and 160 ± 37 μg/kg in ergot of rye and 130 ± 47 μg/kg in ergot of barley. Confirmatory analyses of sclerotia by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric detection identified PAX and its analog 13-desoxypaxilline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the natural occurrence of tremorgenic indole-diterpene alkaloid mycotoxins in ergot sclerotia from rye and barley. Along with details on the analytical methodology developed in this study, particularly PAX-antibody production, the relevance and implications of these findings for food and feed safety are discussed. Presence or absence of elevated levels of tremorgenic mycotoxins, along with the ergot alkaloids, would help in explaining the difference between the two distinct manifestations of historic ergotism, the convulsive and the gangrenous form. Further method development for paxilline and other tremorgenic mycotoxins in cereals used for food and feed is a prerequisite for a comprehensive risk assessment, which seems to be necessary in light of the findings reported here.

   abstract = {Hygienic quality of Tunisian pearl millet flour is always of major concern to consumers as well as all involved in the production, processing and distribution sectors. In the present study, the microbiological and biochemical properties of this' food were examined following gamma-radiation. The D-10-values for the Total Aerobic Plate Count, yeasts and moulds were respectively 1.5 and 3.7 kGy. Furthermore, millet flour is commonly susceptible to mycotoxin contaminations, so the Ochratoxin A residues were also investigated; a reduction of 74% was observed with 10 kGy. Moreover, the radiation process did not significantly alter fatty acids composition of the millet flour as obtained with Gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector technic. The peroxide value had increased from 26.16 to 34.43 meq O-2/kg with 3 kGy. At 1 kGy, we noticed an important loss of vitamin A of about 88.6%. In contrast, the total phenolic content, the ABTS-RSA and the DPPH-RSA of the radiated millet flour exhibited non-significant changes (p < 0.05). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As Tunisian population is a big consumer of cereals mainly durum wheat, human exposure to DON can be, consequently high. This survey was performed to study the occurrence of DON in Tunisian durum wheat area during the crop of 2007. A total of 65 samples of durum wheat from five cultivating locations in the North of Tunisia, the major cropping area, were analysed. To detect and to quantify the mycotoxin DON, an efficient HPLC/UV method was developed, including immunoaffinity step for DON extraction from durum wheat followed by liquid chromatography (LC) for quantification. As DON is a water soluble toxin, the extraction procedure from wheat samples was performed using water. Samples were centrifuged then passed through the immunoaffinity columns. After column's washing, the toxin was slowly eluted by methanol. Wheat sample extracts were injected to the LC system set at a wavelength of 220 nm. From 65 samples, 83% showed DON contamination with averages ranging from 12.8 ± 5% to 30.5 ± 13.3% μg/g exceeding the maximum permitted limit of 1.75 μg/g set by the European Commission in wheat. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A survey of the natural occurrence of deoxynivalenol (DON), the most common Fusarium mycotoxin in small grain cereals, in barley harvested in the main cropping regions in Northern Tunisia in the 2009 harvest was conducted. A total of 72 samples were analysed for DON using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV visible detector set at 220 nm. Between 36% and 100% of the samples were positive for DON with averages ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 mgkg -1. A positive correlation between DON levels and temperature was seen; on the other side no correlation between DON contents and rainfall was observed.

   abstract = {Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by fungi such as Penicillium verrucosum and Aspergillium spp. and has been found to have a variety of potentially deadly toxic effects. The favoured substrate for fungal growth and OTA production appears to be cereals and flour-based products, including bread. Due to the dietary relevance of bread for the Portuguese population, it is imperative that its OTA content remains well within safe quantities. As such, bread samples collected from commercial surfaces across the Algarve region and from the city of Bragança during the winter of 2007 were tested for OTA through extraction with immunoaffinity columns and quantification by liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection. Although OTA content was found to be above the limit of quantification in approximately 60% and 50% of the analysed samples from Algarve and Bragança, respectively, all samples were found to be compliant with European Commission. OTA content reached maximums of 0.49 ng/g in Algarve and 0.43 ng/g in Bragança, and was thus below the maximum limit established by European legislation for bread of 3 ng/g. The results of the present study put the estimated daily intake of OTA from bread at approximately 0.26 ng/kg bw/day in Algarve and 0.38 ng/kg bw/day in Bragança, circa 1.5% and 2.0% of the TDI established by either the EFSA or the FAO/WHO, or over 4.5% and 6.5% if we consider the FAO/WHO advised bread consumption of 250 g/day. These results seem to suggest that, in these two Portuguese regions, OTA contamination is well under control and unlikely to represent a threat to consumer health. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Fusarium mycotoxins are a relevant problem in the cereal supply chain at a worldwide level, with wheat, maize and barley being the main contaminated crops. Mould growth can happen in the pre-harvest phase and also during transport and storage due to ineffective drying conditions. Among Fusarium toxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) is considered the most important contaminant in wheat due to its widespread occurrence. In the last years the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission have frequently expressed opinions on Fusarium toxins, setting limits, regulations and guidelines in order to reduce their levels in raw materials and food commodities. In particular, European legislation (Reg. 1881/2006) sets the maximum limit for DON in flour and bread as 750 and 500 μgkg-1 respectively. Relatively few studies have taken into account the loss of trichothecenes during processing, focusing on how processing factors may influence their degradation. In particular, the description of DON behaviour during bread-making is very difficult, since complex physico-chemical modifications occur during the transformation of the raw ingredients into the final product. In the present study, we studied how DON concentration may be influenced by modifying bread-making parameters, with a special emphasis on the fermentation and baking stages, starting from a naturally contaminated flour at both pilot and industrial scales. Exploiting the power of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to consider the great complexity of the studied system, the obtained model shows satisfying goodness-of-fit and prediction, suggesting that the baking step (time/temperature ranges) is crucial for minimizing native DON level in bread. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

Wheat kernels (cultivar Ritmo) were sampled in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006 and Fusarium-damaged kernels were separated from sound grain based on visual assessment. Subsequently, grain lots containing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of damaged kernels were compiled. Each lot was split and the spectrometric reflectance (wavelengths 350-2500. nm) was measured using subgroup one, while the concentration of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in subgroup two. DON concentrations in batches classified as sound were not significantly different from 0. Estimating DON contents from the percentage of Fusarium-damaged kernels was impeded by vast variability, resulting in a coefficient of determination of 0.49. Using spectrometric data subjected to partial least square regression allowed estimating DON contents with higher accuracy, in particular at elevated percentages of damaged kernels. The coefficient of determination was 0.84 for the relationship between DON contents estimated based on spectrometric data and the DON contents measured. The intercept of a regression line fitted through a plot of estimated versus measured DON contents was 0.89 ± 3.61 mg/kg. Since intercept + standard error was larger than the actual legal limit (1.25 mg DON per kg dry grain in the European Union), the spectrometric procedure was still not precise enough to allow a reliable separation of grain samples with DON contents below 1.25. mg/kg from samples with DON contents above the limit. However, spectrometric data also allowed estimating the DON content of the average damaged kernel within a given lot composed of sound and damaged kernels, which is probably the reason for the reduction of the fraction of unexplained variance by 35% compared to the visual approach and illustrates that spectrometric approaches can make a contribution to reducing DON contents of wheat grain. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite the different weather conditions, both mycotoxin concentration level and co-contamination frequency were found to be lower in winter wheat and rye grain than in spring wheat and barley grain in 2006 and 2007. In the humid 2007, mycotoxin levels in grain as well as cooccurrence frequency were considerably higher in either types of cereal, than those in 2006. Statistical data analysis of grain mycotoxin contamination revealed significant species, even cultivar, effects on trichothecene concentrations in grain when comparing spring wheat cultivars (Triso and Nandu) in 2006, both spring wheat with barley and two cultivars of barley (Luoke and Prestige) in 2007. In most cases, positive correlation existed among grain co-contaminated mycotoxins, but the relationships among mycotoxins were variable both in trend and strength depending on the species, cultivar and comparable pair of mycotoxins. Our research evidence suggests that mycotoxin accumulation was considerably influenced not only by the weather conditions during the crop growing period but also by the crop seasonal type. As a result, this fact should be considered when estimating food safety.},

Penicillium verrucosum, an important OTA producer typical of temperate and cold climates, is much more frequently found on cereals in countries where they occasionally have OTA problems as in North European countries compared with South Europe, where levels of OTA generally seem to be lower or is not detected. The aim of this study was to determine, identify and characterize the occurrence of potential OTA-producing Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. from retail wheat flours purchased in the Spanish market and used for human consumption. A total of 105 Aspergillus isolates were analyzed in order to know whether they are able to produce OTA and/or citrinin (CIT). None of these isolates were able to produce these mycotoxins. However, 17 suspected P. verrucosum isolates were recovered and confirmed by RAPD analyses. Eleven isolates were OTA producers and 14 isolates produced CIT. Our results confirm the potential risk of OTA and CIT production in wheat flours if stored improperly and the occurrence of P. verrucosum in South European countries. This was the only species able to produce these mycotoxins. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nowadays, the European Union (EU) has still not regulated the maximum residue limit of As in commercial samples of rice and rice-based products, although it is actively working on the topic. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is collecting data on total arsenic (t-As) and i-As from different rice-producing regions not only from EU countries but also from other parts of the world to finally set up this maximum threshold. As Iran is a rice-producing country, the aim of this work was to evaluate the contents of t-As and i-As in 15 samples of Iranian white, nonorganic, and aromatic rice collected from the most important rice-producing regions of the country. The means of t-As and i-As were 120 and 82 μg/kg, respectively. The experimental i-As mean in Iranian rice was below the Chinese standard for the i-As in rice, 150 μg/kg, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) limit, 200 μg/kg. Therefore, Iranian rice seems to have reasonable low i-As content and it is safe to be marketed in any market, including China and the EU. © 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

Acrylamide, produced during thermal processing of carbohydrate-rich foods, is classified as "probably carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine acrylamide levels in biscuits and breakfast cereals considering the widespread use of these products for all ages. Method. Acrylamide determination was carried out in 56 samples by HPLC-UV technique. Results and discussion. The results showed a considerable variability in the contents of acrylamide in the samples analysed, most likely due to differences in industrial processing and ingredients. The percentages of contaminated samples tested were very high (95.5% of the biscuits and 75% of the breakfast cereals) with a wide range of contamination: from 30 μg/kg to 940 μg/kg. Our results showed that 22.7% of biscuits and 33% of breakfast cereals exceeded the indicative values recommended by EC 2013/647 set at 500 μg/kg and 200-400 μg/kg (according to the composition) respectively. Conclusions. Our findings suggest concern about the risk for human health.},

Samples were analyzed for both groups of mycotoxins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dry milling of corn led to a heterogeneous distribution of the two groups of mycotoxins in the different parts of the grain, with increased levels in fractions processed from outer layers (animal feed flour and corn flour) and decreased levels in fractions processed from inner portions, such as corn meal and flaking grits. Levels of fumonisins in cornflakes were lower than 400 μg/kg, the maximum tolerable limit set by the EU. By contrast, three samples of final product were found to exceed the aflatoxin maximum tolerable limit of 4 μg/kg. Animal feed flour showed concentration factors of 317 and 288% for fumonisins and aflatoxins, respectively. Food traceability system was used by the industrial companies which processed corn into breakfast cereals. Nevertheless, even though the use of food traceability, which is defined as the ability to trace any food, feed, food-producing animal or substance that will be used for consumption through all stages of production, processing and distribution, only initial fumonisin contamination of whole corn and contamination of animal feed flour and corn flour were found to be correlated. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the maize silage stored in horizontal silos is exposed to air and can be spoiled by fungi. Potentially toxigenic fungi have been found in maize silage, and about 300 mycotoxins have been detected. Among these mycotoxins, the most harmful for feed and food safety are aflatoxins. The aim of the study was to set up a specific method to detect aflatoxins in maize silage, and to investigate whether aflatoxin contamination in maize silage depends on the level of field contamination of the crop, and whether the occurrence of aerobic spoilage during ensiling has any effect on the final contamination of the silage. RESULTS: A method for the determination of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 in maize silage using high-performance liquid chromagraphy with fluorescence detection has been developed and validated. Recoveries of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2 spiked over the 0.25 to 5 μg kg -1 range averaged 74-94%. The results of laboratory scale and farm scale ensiling experiments indicated that aflatoxins could increase when silage is exposed to air during conservation or during the feed-out phase. CONCLUSIONS: The method here proposed to detect aflatoxins in silages has proved to be sensitive and is able to detect levels of 0.1 and 0.5 ng mL -1 for AFB 1 and AFG 1, and between 0.025 and 0.125 ng mL -1 for AFB 2 and AFG 2. This study also provides evidence of aflatoxin accumulation in whole crop maize silage as a result of aerobic exposure. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Cereals are commonly colonized by Fusarium species and often contaminated with mycotoxins that have a major impact on health, welfare and productivity. Among the mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species, fumonisins are usually present in maize and maize-based products, but in the last ten years natural occurrence of fumonisins in wheat in different regions have been observed. This review provides information on the occurrence of fumonisins in wheat and wheat by products around the world. Also, data on ecophysiology of Fusarium proliferatum, one of the main species associated to fumonisin presence in wheat are included. Some data on strategies to reduce the problem are included. The possible human exposure risk of these toxins through the wheat consumption in areas where this cereal represents the main staple food is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However the impact of rice straw burning on polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) concentrations is not known. In this study concentrations of these pollutants were measured at a farm site and two nearby sites during rice straw (open) burning and non-burning periods. During non-burning periods atmospheric PCDD/F and PBDE concentrations ranged from 0.0263 to 0.0329pg I-TEQ/Nm3 and 43.5 to 58.3 pg/Nm3 respectively, and were similar at all of the sites. During rice straw burning periods PCDD/F and PBDE concentrations measured near the combustion (farm) site increased dramatically by six to twenty times. The strong correlation between the natural logarithm of PBDE and PCDD/F concentrations (r=0.949, p&lt;0.01) at each site indicates that the elevated PCDD/Fs and PBDEs were due to emissions from the rice straw burning. The calculated emission factors, determined using the burned carbon method and the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term Dispersion Model (ISCST3), ranged from 12.6 to 14.5ng TEQ/kg Cburned and 11.7 to 14.5μg/kg Cburned, for PCDD/Fs and PBDEs respectively. The PBDE emission factors were at least 38 times higher than those of PCDD/Fs, revealing that rice straw burning is an important PBDE emission source. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Concentrations of OP pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). The results showed that 9.3% of the samples contained detectable residues of at least one of the seven target OP pesticides (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, omethoate, methamidophos, parathion-methyl, parathion and triazophos) mainly used for agriculture in China, with concentrations ranging 0.011-1.756 mg kg-1. Rice consumption data was obtained from an individual food consumption survey. Relative potency factors (RPFs) for each pesticide were calculated with methamidophos as the index compound (IC), using 1- or 2-year chronic non-observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) for AChE inhibition, mostly in rat brain, obtained from international evaluations of pesticides. Exposure to AChE-inhibiting pesticides for the population above 7 years old at P99.9 represented 52-94.5% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) expressed as methamidophos. Estimated exposure for children aged 2-4 and 4-7 years at P99.9 were 119 and 104.3% of the ADI level, respectively. This study suggests that a yearly monitoring program for OP pesticide residues and strict implementation of the national safety standard for milled rice is necessary.},

   abstract = {Irrigation with eutrophic water containing microcystins-LR (MC-LR) poses a potential risk to crops. However, the accumulation of MC-LR in rice grains and the mechanism of MC-LR-induced inhibition in rice roots are not understood. In this study, we detected the accumulation of MC-LR in rice grains collected from Taihu Lake region. MC-LR could accumulate in rice grains, but the risk evaluation suggested that MC-LR levels in rice grains from Taihu Lake region may not pose a threat to human health currently. In addition, MC-LR with low concentrations did not affect the growth of rice roots. However, MC-LR with high concentrations impeded the rice root morphogenesis by inhibiting root elongation, crown root formation, and lateral root development from primordia. Treatment with high concentrations of MC-LR stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) in rice roots. Exogenous NO treatment reversed the inhibition of rice root growth under MC-LR stress. These results indicated that ROS and NO played important roles in the development of rice roots in responding to MC-LR stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The present work had as an objective to determine the pesticide residues presence in samples of bean, egg and rice, as well as estimate the dietary intake of the compounds detected in the analysis using the ADI parameter and the food consumption data from IBGE, 2004 and GEMS/FOOD, 2003. The study evaluated 311 bean (dry) samples, 150 egg samples and 73 rice (polished) samples, commercialized in Sao Paulo City. A multiresidue method DFG S19 was employed and almost 140 active ingredients were studied. Pesticide residues not allowed for the commodities such as alachlor, amethryn and P dimetenamide were detected, respectively, in 0.65% of bean samples, 0.7% of egg samples and 1.3% of rice samples. The procymidone residues were above the MRL and were found in 0.6% of the bean samples. Chronic dietary intake of procymidone and P dimetenamide was evaluated, however in this study it was not considered any processing of food which could modify and even reduce the levels of these compounds. ©Sociedade Brasileira de Toxicologia.},

   abstract = {Ochratoxin A (OTA) was analysed in composite samples of cereal-based baby foods, beer, breakfast cereals (corn-and rice and wheat-based), loaf bread, peanuts and pistachios. Foodstuffs were collected in hypermarkets and supermarkets from 12 cities in the Spanish region of Catalonia, and composite samples were prepared for analysis involving liquid-liquid extraction, followed by immunoaffinity column clean-up and HPLC with fluorescence detection. Consumption data for the selected foodstuffs were collected by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. The studied population was grouped by age in infants, children, adolescents and adults; and exposure to OTA through the specified foodstuffs, and through wine and coffee, was assessed. Exposure assessment was done through deterministic and probabilistic modelling of the contamination and consumption data. OTA occurrence and mean of positive samples (ng g(-1) or ng ml(-1), for beer) were the following: 8.7% and 0.233 in baby foods; 88.7% and 0.022 in beer; 2.8% and 0.728 in corn-based breakfast cereals; 25% and 0.293 in wheat-based breakfast cereals; 12.9% and 0.283 in loaf bread; 41.7% and 0.241 in peanuts; and 2.9% and 0.228 in pistachios. The median estimated daily intake of OTA through the foodstuffs by each age group were below the latest provisional tolerable daily intakes (PTDIs) of 17 and 14 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2006 and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2007, respectively, ranging from 1% and 2% of those values in adolescents and children, to 3% and 11% in adults and infants.},

Rice-based cereals contained MeHg levels significantly higher than those of nonrice cereals, indicating that MeHg in rice could be source of MeHg in cereals. Cereal consumption could be a potential pathway of MeHg exposure for infants, as the EDI through cereal consumption amounted to 4-122% of the MeHg reference dose, suggesting the necessity of further evaluation of the potential health risk of dietary MeHg exposure to infants. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Pesticides were detected in all local (median = 1, range: 1-3, n = 71) and imported (median = 1, range: 1-6, n = 13) samples. Multiple pesticides (>1 pesticide) were detected in about 30% local samples and 39% imported samples. Eight different pesticides were detected in total. The most frequently detected pesticides were mercaptothion (99%), permethrin (19%) and chlorpyrifos (17%). Nine (11%) samples exceeded the EU wheat MRL for permethrin (0.05 mg/kg) which included 7 (10%) local samples and 2 (15%) imported samples. The highest fenitrothion level (0.65 mg/kg) corresponds to an intake that was below but near the estimated short-term safety threshold. The results call for an investigation into the levels of pesticide residues in cereal-based food and for tighter regulation and regular monitoring by government and industry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, very little documentation is available on the impact of these factors on maize in Ghana. This study focused on post-harvest losses of maize and assessed grain MC, insect pests and mycotoxin (aflatoxin and fumonisin) levels on-farm at three stages, during the major and minor seasons (primary and secondary harvest seasons, respectively). Grain MC decreased significantly from the field stage (17.2–19.0%) to the post-drying stage (12.4–14.2%). The mean grain MC was significantly greater in the major season (20.4%) than in the minor season (12.5%). Maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella Olivier, square-neck grain beetle, Cathartus quadricollis Guerin-Meneville, and corn sap beetle, Carpophilus dimidiatus Fabricius were the dominant insect species that attacked maize on-farm. Mean numbers of each species were generally significantly greater in the minor season than in the major season, but in both seasons, greater numbers were detected at the heaping stage compared to field and post-drying stages. Percentage insect damaged kernels and weight loss were significantly lower at the field stage than at both the heaped and post-drying stages; statistically similar levels were observed in the latter two stages. Mean aflatoxin (ppb) and fumonisin (ppm) levels were significantly higher in the major season (29.1 ppb, 1.6 ppm) than in the minor season (3.5 ppb, 1.0 ppm). Results showed variation between locations sampled, but in general more insect damage and quality deterioration occurred during the major season compared to the minor season. Farmers should dry immediately after harvest to reduce risk of damage from insect pests and mycotoxins. © 2017},

   abstract = {A survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of fumonisin B-1, B-2 and B-3 during 2007 in 186 samples of organic and conventional locally available corn products. Samples included baby food (n = 62), corn flour (11), cornflakes (23), pasta (14), cookies (17) and other corn products (59) were obtained from popular markets of Valencia (Spain) and Perugia (Italy). The analytical method used pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyser. Of the 104 Spanish samples, 22% contained levels in the range of 2-449 mu g kg(-1), 2-229 mu g kg(-1) and 6-105 mu g kg(-1) for FB1, FB2 and FB3, respectively, while 19 (23%) of the 82 Italian samples were positive with quantifiable levels between 2-235 mu g kg(-1), 3-187 mu g kg(-1), and 4-40 mu g kg(-1) for fumonisins B-1, B-2 and B-3, respectively. Overall, none of the Italian samples and only one organic baby food sample from a Spanish market was above the maximum permitted levels established by European legislation. Fumonisins were found mostly in corn flour followed by cookies and cornflakes. Eleven samples from Spain and nine samples from Italy were organic products, being contaminated the 72% and 77% of the samples, respectively. Analysis of the results showed that levels of fumonisins in corn products were similar in Italy and Spain. The safety of fumonisin intake through corn products was demonstrated by the calculation of the estimated daily intake of both populations considering organic and conventional products separately, which ranged from 1.7 x 10(-3) to 0.72 mu g kg(-1) bw day(-1) and comparing them with the provisional maximum total daily intake (PMTDI) of 2 mu g kg(-1) bw day(-1) established by the European Union.},

   abstract = {Introduction and objective. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of several mycotoxins produced by certain Fusarium species that frequently infect wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley and other grains in the field or during storage. Guilan, Golestan and Mazandaran areas are located in the North Iran with favorite conditions for Fusarium growth. DON affects animal and human health causing vomiting, acute temporary nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever. Materials and methods. In this study, a total of 96 wheat flour samples of different types were collected during summer 2013 from six flour mills in Northern Iran. All samples were analyzed for DON by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. DON was detected in 80 out of 96 wheat flour samples (83.33%), at levels ranging from 23 to1270 μg/kg. The maximum contamination level of DON (1270 μg/kg) was found in whole flour while the minimum value (23 μg/kg) was registered in debranned flour. The mean of contamination was 630.53 μg/kg. Conclusions. According to results obtained, incidence and contamination levels of DON, seem to be a serious problem for public health. Therefore, cereal and cereal based foods should be controlled for the presence of toxins, storage conditions and moisture content, which is considered a major factor in the growth of the Fusarium fungi. © 2014, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

The total counts of fusaria in animal feeds and poultry feed mixtures revealed a high incidence of F. verticillioides, being isolated from all positive samples. Most contaminated samples were maize pellets (71.4%), cotton seed (66.6%), maize powder (60%) and fine wheat bran (50%), respectively, while no Fusarium species was isolated from Bengal gram husk and wheat flakes. All the Fusarium species were identified by the PCR method using genus specific ITS and group specific FUM 1 primers. Of the 374 Fusarium isolates tested with ITS set of primers, all fusaria scored positive, whereas only 244 (65%) isolates tested positive with the FUM 1 set of primers. The specificity of the primers provides the basis for a simple, accurate and precise detection of Fusarium species that represents fumonisin producers, which are a considerable risk for animal, poultry and human health.},

   abstract = {In the present study, a quantitative dietary exposure assessment of mycotoxins and their masked forms was conducted on a national representative sample of the Belgian population using the contamination data of cereal-based foods. Cereal-based food products (n=174) were analysed for the occurrence of deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, zearalenone, α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, T-2-toxin, HT-2-toxin, and their respective masked forms, including, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, zearalenone-4-glucoside, α-zearalenol-4-glucoside, β-zearalenol-4-glucoside and zearalenone-4-sulfate. Fibre-enriched bread, bran-enriched bread, breakfast cereals, popcorn and oatmeal were collected in Belgian supermarkets according to a structured sampling plan and analysed during the period from April 2010 to October 2011. The habitual intake of these food groups was estimated from a national representative food intake survey. According to a probabilistic exposure analysis, the mean (and P95) mycotoxin intake for the sum of the deoxynivalenol-equivalents, zearalenone-equivalents, and the sum of HT-2-and T-2-toxin for all cereal-based foods was 0.1162 (0.4047, P95), 0.0447 (0.1568, P95) and 0.0258 (0.0924, P95)μgkg-1bodyweightday-1, respectively. These values were below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) levels for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 toxin (1.0, 0.25 and 0.1μgkg-1bodyweightday-1, respectively). The absolute level exceeding the TDI for all cereal-based foods was calculated, and recorded 0.85%, 2.75% and 4.11% of the Belgian population, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Since the shipment had passed import controls and was already distributed (mainly to German farms), a massive recall followed. The aim of the current study was to investigate questions, raised by authorities and industry, related to the effectivity of EU sampling procedures, the influence of sample homogenisation procedures and sample storage conditions on the test results, and fungal identification as unexpected mycotoxins were identified during this study. The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority seized a shipload of maize in July 2013, suspected to be contaminated with AFB1. The shipload was sampled according to the 2009 and 2013 EC Sampling Regulations to compare the outcomes of both sampling protocols. Mycotoxin analysis of the incremental samples showed high mean levels of AFB1, aflatoxin G1(AFG1), and ochratoxin A (OTA). Also an extreme inhomogeneous distribution of aflatoxins and OTA was proven. Analysis of samples homogenised according to the slurry method showed improved performance as compared to samples homogenised through dry homogenisation. Sampling and sample homogenisation according to the Regulation from 2013 showed a closer estimate of the 'true' AFB1 content as compared to sampling according to the Regulation from 2009. No influence of laboratory storage conditions on AFB1concentration could be determined. Fungal identification revealed Aspergillus flavus as the main source of AFB1in this shipment. Infrequent occurrence of Aspergillus parasiticus might have been the source of AFG1. The occurrence of sometimes large amounts of OTA could not be explained, however it was suggested that Aspergillus welwitschiae might have played a role. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

In Iran it is the second staple crop after wheat. This study aimed at investigating the level of different heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic, and lead) in rice consumed in Hormozgan province, 2014 Materials and methods: An analytical cross-sectional study that was carried out in 75 samples of Iranian, Pakistani, and Indian rice consumed in Hormozgan province in 2014. The samples were randomly selected and analyzed. Results: The mean concentrations of arsenic, lead and cadmium were 0.045, 0.057 and 0.022 mg/kg, respectively. The maximum level of arsenic was found in unauthorized Indian rice (0.033 mg/kg) and the maximum lead content was observed in unauthorized Pakistani rice (0.070 mg/kg). Conclusion: Due to the high consumption of rice in the country and contamination of rice with heavy metals, it is important to choose safe products to avoid accumulative effect of these metals on human health. © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

DON, produced primarily by Fusarium graminearum, is commonly isolated from grains and feed around the world and affects both animal and human health, producing diarrhea, vomiting, gastrointestinal inflammation, and immunomodulation. An aqueous extract of infant cereal was cleaned by means of an immunoaffinity chromatography column. After the eluate was evaporated and redissolved, DON was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography-UV. The level of quantification for DON was 10 ppb for three types of infant cereal (mixed, barley, and oatmeal); the level of detection was 5 ppb. The protocol we have developed can measure DON between 10 to 500 ppb. An advisory level of 1 ppm for wheat products has been established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, the European Communities (EC) regulations have been set at 200 ppb for cereal-based foods for infants. Only 1 of 52 samples of barley-, mixed-, or oat-based infant cereal purchased in 2008 and 2009 in the United States exceeded the European standard.},

Throughout 2 years, natural Fusarium infection varied significantly between the years and the locations and it ranged from 0.4% to 49.7% for kernels and from 24.2% to 83.8% for stem pieces. Using the agar plate method, 16 different Fusarium species were isolated from kernels and 15 from stem pieces. The Fusarium species composition, prevalence and impact differed between the north and the south and between kernel and stem piece samples. The dominant species on kernels in the north were F. verticillioides (32.9%), F. graminearum (31.3%), F. proliferatum (7.3%) and F. crookwellense (7.1%), in the south F. verticillioides (57.1%), F. subglutinans (24.6%), F. proliferatum (14.8%) and F. graminearum (1.5%) and on stem pieces F. equiseti (36.0%), F. verticillioides (20.1%), F. graminearum (9.5%), F. crookwellense (6.2%) and F. subglutinans (6.2%). In the south, fumonisin concentration of most hybrids exceeded guidance values for animal feed. Other Fusarium species isolated were F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. oxysporum, F. poae, F. sambucinum, F. semitectum, F. sporotrichioides, F. solani, F. tricinctum and F. venenatum. Maize hybrids varied in their susceptibility to Fusarium infection. Because of the high diversity of Fusarium species encountered in Switzerland representing a high toxigenic potential, we propose to screen maize hybrids for resistance against various Fusarium species and examine maize produce for several mycotoxins in order to ensure feed safety. © KNPV 2009.},

Concerning the predominant frequency of deoxynivalenol (DON) producing Fusarium graminearum in wheat, DON occurrence in the State of Parana (21 samples) and Rio Grande do Sul (15 samples), as well as the risk assessment of daily intake of DON in Londrina-PR, Brazil were evaluated. DON was detected in 72.2 % samples by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which ranged from non-detectable to 1,592.21 mu g/kg, with average of 321.59 mu g/kg (limit of quantification= 87.75 mu g/kg). In order to calculate the estimated daily intake (EDI) of DON, a Food Frequency Questionnaire was applied to 260 persons (64.8 % female and 35.2 % male, from 8 to 76 years-old). The main food ingested were pasta (151 g/week) and bread (267 g/week), and based in these items, the average estimated daily intake (EDI) of DON was 0.308 mu g/kg body weight/day. This EDI was lower than Provisional Tolerable Daily Maximum Intake (PTDMI) settled in 1 mu g/kg b.w./day, although two persons showed estimated DON ingestion above PTDMI. The data ratify the importance of continuous monitoring and risk assessment targeted on DON exposure.},

   abstract = {Maize silage is a widely used feed product for cattle worldwide, which may be contaminated with mycotoxins, pre- and post-harvest. This concerns both farmers and consumers. To assess the exposure of Danish cattle to mycotoxins from maize silage, 99 samples of whole-crop maize (ensiled and un-ensiled) were analyzed for their contents of 27 mycotoxins and other secondary fungal metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method specifically targets the majority of common pre- and post-harvest fungi associated with maize silage in Denmark. Sixty-one samples contained one or more of the 27 analytes in detectable concentrations. The most common mycotoxins were zearalenone, enniatin B nivalenol and andrastin A, found in 34%, 28%, 16% and 15% of the samples, respectively. None of the samples contained mycotoxins above the EU recommended maximum concentrations for Fusarium toxins in cereal-based roughage. Thus, the present study does not indicate that Danish maize silage in general is a cause of acute single mycotoxin intoxications in cattle. However, 31 of the samples contained multiple analytes; two samples as much as seven different fungal metabolites. Feed rations with maize silage may therefore contain complex mixtures of fungal secondary metabolites with unknown biological activity. This emphasizes the need for a thorough examination of the effects of chronic exposure and possible synergistic effects. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Deoxynivalenol (DON) was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 250 μgkg-1 in 72% of maize and 10% of wheat silages. Average DON concentrations were 854 and 621μgkg-1, respectively, and maximum concentrations 3142 and 1165 μgkg-1, respectively. Zearalenone was detected above the LOQ of 25 μgkg-1 in 49% of maize and 6% of grass silages. Average zearalenone concentrations were 174 and 93 μgkg-1, respectively, and maximum concentrations 943 and 308 μgkg-1, respectively. The incidences and average concentrations of DON and zearalenone in maize silage were highest in 2004. The incidence of other mycotoxins was low: fumonisin B1 and 15-acetyl-DON were detected in 1.4 and 5% of maize silages, respectively, and roquefortin C in 0.8% of grass silages. None of the silages contained aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, sterigmatocystin, diacetoxyscirpenol, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, penicillinic acid, or mycophenolic acid. This study demonstrates that maize silage is an important source of DON and zearalenone in the diet of dairy cattle. Since the carryover of these mycotoxins into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feed is not considered to be of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers. Potential implications for animal health are discussed. © 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

   abstract = {Cereal grains, like sorghum, are prone to fungal contamination, which under conductive conditions may produce mycotoxins. These secondary metabolites are naturally occurring contaminants whose presence in food-and feedstuffs is both unpredictable and unavoidable. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is recognized as one of the most important and toxic mycotoxins featuring significant public health and agro-economic impact. Cereal and cereal derived products are undoubtedly the main contributors to human exposure to OTA. Such acknowledged evidence prompted vast research devoted to cereal grains and derived products, particularly in terms of surveillance. However, most research on mycotoxins has focused on major grain foods with little focus on nontraditional grains like sorghum, despite its increasing potential and significance in poorer and developing economies. For all these reasons, this chapter surveys the occurrence, extent and impact of OTA contamination in sorghum and their derived products, by entering in both food and feed chain. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

   abstract = {Citrinin is a mycotoxin produced by fungal species belonging to the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Monascus. It can be found in cereals, fruits, vegetables, and fruit juices. CTN is primarily nephrotoxic and has been classified by IARC as group 3 of carcinogens. In this study, data on CTN as a possible contaminant of food supplements based on red yeast rice and scientific papers on CTN occurrence in commercially available food supplements are discussed. Studies conducted in the past 5-10 years show that preparations containing CTN are available to patients. In some preparations, CTN amounts considerably higher than the recommended concentration (based on tests carried out on animal models) were found. In this study, the presence of CTN in the analysed samples was compared to the guidelines effective in the European Union. In addition, CTN co-occurred with other mycotoxins, notably OTA, which was confirmed in foods (cereals and fruits). The long-term exposure to contaminated food may increase the risk of developing nephrotoxicosis or kidney cancer. Manufacturers of these supplements should control the presence of CTN in raw material and a better legal framework for dietary supplements should be adopted in the future in order to ensure patient safety in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia involving red rice and thus avoid any risk of CTN nephrotoxic effect.},

   abstract = {Each year (2002-2005), approximately 100 samples of barley from fields of known agronomy were analysed for ten trichothecenes by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) including deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, 3-acetyl DON, 15-acetyl DON, fusarenone X, T-2 toxin (T2), HT-2 toxin (HT2), diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, and T-2 triol. Samples were also analysed for moniliformin and zearalenone by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Of the ten trichothecenes analysed from 446 harvest samples of barley, only two, diacetoxyscirpenol and neosolaniol, were not detected. The concentrations of type A trichothecenes were similar to those that occurred in wheat over the same period, whilst those of type B trichothecenes were markedly lower. Deoxynivalenol was the most frequently detected Fusarium mycotoxin, present above the limit of quantification (10 μg kg-1) in 57% of samples, and was usually present at the highest concentration. A single sample (0.2%) exceeded the legal limit for DON in unprocessed barley over the 4-year period. Moniliformin and zearalenone were both rarely detected (2% of samples greater than 10 μg kg-1 for both toxins) with maximum concentrations of 45 and 44 μg kg-1, respectively. Year and region had a significant effect on DON and HT2+T2, but there was no significant difference in the concentration of these mycotoxins between organic and conventional samples. Overall, the risk of UK barley exceeding the newly introduced legal limits for Fusarium mycotoxins in cereals intended for human consumption is very low, but the percentage of samples above these limits will fluctuate between years. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

   abstract = {Zearalenone is an oestrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species which can infect cereals, in particular wheat and maize. The predominant species responsible for zearalenone production is Fusarium graminearum, which also produces the trichothecene mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol. The infection and subsequent mycotoxin production by Fusarium spp. is largely dependent on rainfall at flowering and before harvest. High concentrations of zearalenone in particular, appear to be produced during delayed wet harvests. There has been a recent and ongoing increase in F. graminearum incidence resulting in increased occurrence of deoxynivalenol and zearalenone across northern Europe, where delayed wet harvests are more common. Zearalenone contamination of grain is largely restricted to the outer layers of wheat grain and therefore is partitioned into the bran fraction during milling. This results in higher concentrations of zearalenone in high fibre cereal products. After the delayed wet harvest in the UK in 2008, 29% of wheat at harvest exceeded the European limit for unprocessed cereals of 100 μg/kg. This resulted in difficulties in sourcing bran which would allow production of high fibre breakfast cereals within zearalenone limits and the European Commission provided a temporary derogation for high fibre breakfast cereals of 100 μg/kg zearalenone until 31 October 2009. Rainfall data and zearalenone concentrations in UK wheat from the last ten years were used to predict the occurrence of high zearalenone in wheat (10% or more of unprocessed wheat greater than 100 μg/ kg zearalenone). High zearalenone was predicted to occur one year in five for northern Europe which matches the observed incidence for the UK within the last ten years. As a consequence, current legislative limits for zearalenone in cereals and cereal products could impact on the availability of high fibre cereal products one year in five. © 2011 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   pages = {421-437},
   section = {Not Relevant},
   abstract = {In recent years, countries such as Bolivia, Germany, China, the U.S.A. and Mexico have increasingly focused on the growth and development of pigmented maize cultivars and hybrids. Pigmented maize cultivars produce kernels of multiple colors, and are included among the 346 described races of maize. These pigments can include yellow, black, purple, blue, red and orange, as well as other less common shades. The blue-red coloration of pigmented maize is caused by the high concentrations of phenolic compounds called anthocyanins, included of the flavonoids group. These chemical compounds are contained in the pericarp, the aleurone layer and between the endosperm of the grain. Anthocyanins give a pigmented color to maize products and add nutraceutical value (antioxidant capacity). Anthocyanins are present as heterosides, and their structures are based in the aglycone form (C3-C6-C3 backbone). Attached to the aglycone, are hydroxyl and methoxyl substituents in different positions, which can yield a molecule named anthocyanidin. Only six anthocyanidins are found in fruits and vegetables. Anthocyanidins can be linked to sugars especially glucose, galactose, rhamnose and various other disaccharides and trisaccharides. Anthocyanins can be acylated by the acylation of sugar residues with organic acids, such as aliphatic or cinnamic acids. The most common analysis applied to study the profile and content of anthocyanins is HPLC, generally coupled to UV, DAD, MS, or HSCCC (high-speed counter-current chromatography). In this chapter, the anthocyanin contents of some colored maize grains are described along with their anthocyanin profiles. According to several profile analyses performed by different research groups, the main anthocyanins contained in blue and purple maize cultivars are cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3- galactoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-glucoside, peonidin 3-glucoside and some malonyl acylated derivatives. Furthermore, it has been reported that purple and blue maize cultivars from China and Mexico have the highest anthocyanin contents, at up to 3,045 mg·kg-1. Pigmented maize kernels can be used to obtain a variety of natural colorants but are mainly used to produce foods that preserve the original anthocyanin contents in order to provide additional health benefits for consumers. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A survey of 74 samples consisting of 12 wet-milled maize germ, 12 dry-milled maize germ, 25 refined corn oil, and 25 corn oil margarine was conducted. Results revealed that 100% and 87.5% of maize germ samples presented FB1 and FB2, respectively, attaining concentrations for the sum of both toxins of 1302±541μgkg-1 in wet-milled and 820±831μgkg-1 in dry-milled maize germ. The lower incidence of FB1, FB2 and DON in edible oil and margarine (4-8%) may be related with the industrial processes for their obtaining besides the high water-solubility of these mycotoxins. In contrast, 25% of maize germ samples were positive for ZEA as well as 32% of corn oil and 24% of margarine, which may be related with its lipophilic nature. A number of samples exceeded the maximum limits indicating that strict control is needed, though estimated dietary exposure was less than 0.2% tolerable daily intakes in all cases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In 2007 a European Union regulation set maximum concentrations of mycotoxins in maize and derivatives of 4000 ppb for fumonisins B 1 and B 2, 1750 ppb for deoxynivalenol, and 350 ppb for zearalenone. To assess the safety of French maize food, investigations are currently being carried out by the national Biological Risk Monitoring network. Here, 84 plots were cropped with the Bt maize MON 810 and its isogenic non-Bt counterpart in 2005 and 2006 in Southwestern France. Mycotoxin levels were measured in grain at harvest. Fumonisins B 1 and B 2, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data were analysed statistically using non-parametric tests for mycotoxins and analysis of variance for weather variables. As the climate was homogenous inside the experimental area, the transgenic event introduced into the maize was the only key parameter which differed between Bt and non-Bt maize plots. Our results show that Bt maize decreased concentrations of fumonisins by 90% and zearalenone by 50%, whereas the concentration of deoxynivalenol was slightly increased. Those findings suggest a competition among Fusarium species that produce fumonisins or trichothecenes. According to the European regulation, 93% of the Bt maize crops can be sold, compared with only 45% for non-Bt maize plots. Our results thus show that Bt maize improved food safety by greatly reducing mycotoxin levels in field crops in Southwestern France. © 2010 INRA, EDP Sciences.},

   abstract = {Grain storage constitutes a critical point in cereal production. There is an increasing tendency to leave the concept of "commodity" and treat grain production as "food", mostly considering its safety, due to grain quality, integrity and absence of pesticide residues. New generation pesticides are less but still toxic substances. Fenitrothion, mercaptothion, chlorpyriphos, dichlorvos, deltamethrin, phosphine and warfarins are still in use for storage in conventional silo. Wheat is usually affected by fungi, which begin to grow on cultures before harvest and afterwards by mite and insects. Silobag have great advantages when compared to conventional silo, like an important decrease in the need of pesticide use. Adverse effects evaluated on human health in relation to grain storage must consider not only people consuming grain, flour and food products but also workers exposure. Occupational disease associated to grain storage consists of allergy and respiratory diseases, due to exposure to dust, mould and pesticides. Residues control taking place nowadays and new technologies have lead to residues level below established limits, as occurs with the fungicide tebuconazole applied on wheat in the field. Diatomaceus earth insect control during grain storage is replacing traditional pesticide control because of its effectiveness and safety.},

   abstract = {A survey of moulds and mycotoxins was performed on 99 rice samples taken from the Swedish retail market. The main objective was to study the mould and mycotoxin content in basmati rice and rice with a high content of fibre. Samples of jasmine rice as well as long-grain rice were also included. The samples were analysed for their content of ochratoxin A (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2 (HPLC, RIDA*QUICK), and mould (traditional cultivation methods in combination with morphological analysis). The majority of samples were sampled according to European Commission Regulation 401/2006. Subsamples were pooled and mixed before milling and both mould and mycotoxin analyses were performed on milled rice. The results showed that the majority of basmati rice (71%) and many jasmine rice samples (20%) contained detectable levels of aflatoxin B 1 (level of quantification = 0.1 μg aflatoxin kg -1 rice). Two samples of jasmine rice and ten basmati rice samples contained levels over the regulated European maximum limits of 2 μg kg -1 for aflatoxin B 1 or 4 μg kg -1 for total aflatoxins. Aspergillus was the most common mould genus isolated, but also Penicillium, Eurotium, Wallemia, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Alternaria, and Trichotecium were found. The presence of Aspergillus flavus in 21% of the samples indicates that incorrect management of rice during production and storage implies a risk of mould growth and subsequent production of aflatoxin. Rough estimates showed that high rice consumers may have an intake of 2-3 ng aflatoxin kg -1 bodyweight and day-1 from rice alone. This survey shows that aflatoxin is a common contaminant in rice imported to Europe.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Heavy metals and As in rice are of increasing concern in China. In this study, concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Sb, Ni, and As in rice collected from markets in Fuzhou, China, were investigated by ICP-MS and AFS, and their potential health risk to inhabitants were estimated by target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), and target cancer risk (TR). The results showed that the concentrations of the seven studied elements in rice grain were all below the permissible limits of China's national standards for foodstuffs (NY/T 419–2007 and GB 2726–2012). For non-carcinogenic risk, the THQ values of individual elements were within the safe interval. However, without considering the bio-accessibility and speciation of toxic elements, the HI values suggest inhabitants in Fuzhou may experience potential health effects due to rice consumption. Cadmium is the major contributor to HI, followed by As. The TR values of As for adults and children were both higher than the acceptable range. The results of this study suggest that more attention should be paid toward monitoring toxic substances (especially Cd and As) in rice in order to assure the food safety for consumers in Fuzhou, China. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Samples were extracted with methanol/water solution and cleaned by immunoaffinity column. HPLC separation was performed on a C18 Spherisorb analytical column with a mobile phase consisting of water:methanol:acetonitri1e (60:20:20, v/v/v). The method proved to be rapid, selective and reproducible. In-house performance characteristics were established; calibration curves were linear from 0.12 to 8 ng/g for AFs B1 and G1 and from 0.06 to 4 ng/g for AFs B2 and G2. Quantification limits were found to be significantly lower than Tunisian and European aflatoxin regulatory limits. They were 0.16 ng/g for AFB1 and 0.08 ng/g for AFs B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin recoveries in sorghum and pistachios samples spiked at 0.5 and 2 ng/g varied from 68.3 to 87.7%. AFs were detected and quantified in investigated commodities.

   abstract = {Low fertility in rice caused by Chilo suppressalis has led to the use of diazinon to control this pest. Residue of pesticide could penetrate products and also food which can affect public health. The aim of this research was to determine health risk assessment of organophosphorus (OP) pesticide in rice, a strategic crop in Iran. Ninety rice samples were collected from 30 points during harvesting seasons from Rasht Area, Guilan Province, Iran from which 30 samples were prepared. The concentration of diazinon, the most common pesticide used in the study area, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The result indicated that the total average of diazinon in rice samples (31.91 mg/kg) is by far higher than the maximum residue limit recommended by the European Union. According to the results, EDAI was 0.051 mg/kg day, while health risk index in rice was 10.2. Results showed that there is a health risk associated with the lifetime consumption of rice polluted by OP pesticide in the study area.},

   abstract = {Background: Golestan province in northeastern Iran has been known as a high-risk area for esophageal cancer (EC). This study was conducted to assess aflatoxin (AF) contamination of wheat flour (WF) samples in high and low EC-risk areas of Golestan province. Methods: Four WF samples were collected randomly from each of 25 active silos throughout the province in 2009. The levels of AFs were measured using the High-performance liquid chromatography method. Using the data of EC rates obtained from Golestan population-based cancer registry, the province was divided into high and low risk areas for EC. Student t-test and multivariate regression analysis were used to compare the levels of aflatoxins as well as the condition of silos between the two areas. Results: One hundred WF samples were collected. The mean levels of total aflatoxin and aflatoxin B1 was 1.99 and 0.53ngg-1, respectively. The levels of total AF (p=0.03), AFG2 (p=0.02) and AFB1 (p=0.003) were significantly higher in samples obtained from high risk area. Multivariate regression analysis showed that humidity of silo was the most important source of difference between silos of the two areas (p=0.04). Conclusion: We found a positive relationship between AF level of WF samples and the risk of EC. So, AF contamination may be a possible risk factor for EC in our region. We also found that humidity of silos was the most important determinant of AF contamination of WF. Intensive control of silos conditions including humidity and temperature are needed especially in high EC-risk areas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rice samples (n = 157) were collected from four large markets in Kandal Province and analysed for As using inductively coupled mass spectrometry. The mean As concentration for Cambodian rice (0.185 A mu g g(-1), range 0.047-0.771 A mu g g(-1)) was higher than that for imported rice from Vietnam and Thailand (0.162 and 0.157 A mu g g(-1), respectively) with mean As concentrations highest in rice from Prey Veng Province resulting in a daily dose of 1.77 A mu g kg(-1) b.w. (body weight) d(-1). Between unmilled rice varieties, Cambodian-grown White Sticky Rice had the highest mean As concentration (0.234 A mu g g(-1)), whilst White Sticky Rice produced in Thailand had the lowest (0.125 A mu g g(-1)), suggesting that localised conditions have greater bearing over rice As concentrations than differences in As uptake between individual varieties themselves. A rice and water consumption survey for 15 respondents in the village of Preak Russey revealed mean consumption rates of 522 g d(-1) of rice and 1.9 L d(-1) of water. At water As concentrations > 1000 A mu g L-1, the relative contribution to the daily dose from rice is low. When water As concentrations are lowered to 50 A mu g L-1, daily doses from rice and water are both generally below the 3.0 A mu g kg(-1) b.w. d(-1) benchmark daily limit for a 0.5 % increase in lung cancer, yet when combined they exceeded this value in all but three respondents.},

The aim of the study was to determine the distribution of arsenic, lead and cadmium in the pearled fractions of different types of common wheats in order to identify potential safety threats which may arise from the use of intermediate pearled fractions. Arsenic, lead and cadmium were all found to be mainly concentrated in the outer layers of the kernel, but their distribution varied on an element-specific basis. The concentration of arsenic gradually decreased moving towards the internal layers of the kernel. Whereas, the concentration of lead dropped suddenly after the removal of the first fraction corresponding to 5% of the kernel weight. Cadmium was found to be distributed more uniformly in the grain and, after the removal of 25% of the kernel weight, the residual pearled kernel on average retained 56% of the cadmium detected in the whole grain. A careful selection of the raw material, which should meet specific requirements especially in terms of cadmium contamination, should be made in order to avoid any potential risk for the health of consumers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Silage is one of the most important feed sources for bovines. Mycotoxin contamination of feedstuffs is a worldwide concern. The aim of this study was to compare mycobiota and levels of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and patulin (PAT) in corn trench silos and silo bags. RESULTS: Dry matter was higher in trench silos. Counts varied from not detected to 10 8 CFU g -1 in both trench silos and silo bags. Isolation frequencies of Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp. were higher in trench silos, whereas Penicillium spp. was higher in silo bags. Silo bags showed less diversity than trench silos. Strains isolated produced AFB 1, FB 1 and PAT. In trench silos, AFB 1 was the only mycotoxin detected (1-160 μg kg -1). In silo bags AFB 1 levels varied from 5.8 to 47.4 μg kg -1. DON was detected in two silo bag samples. CONCLUSION: When handling is adequate the reduction of mould and mycotoxin contamination in silo bags is considerable. This study will enable estimation of the mycotoxicological risk of different ensiling practices and determination of the most adequate method to minimize economic losses and reduce hazard to animal and human health. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Background: Red yeast rice (RYR) is a widely available dietary supplement used by millions of patients as an alternative therapy for hyperlipidemia. It contains 14 active compounds called monacolins that inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Although studies have suggested that some formulations of RYR may be effective and safe for lipid lowering, monacolin levels are not standardized among marketed products and are generally not published on labels. We evaluated monacolin levels in 12 commercial RYR formulations and tested for citrinin, a mycotoxin that is nephrotoxic in animals. Methods: Each formulation of RYR was labeled "600 mg/capsule" of active product. Analyses for monacolins and citrinin were performed between August 2006 and June 2008 using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy detection. Laboratory analyses of RYR products were conducted by ConsumerLab.com, White Plains, New York. Results: There was marked variability in the 12 RYR products in total monacolins (0.31-11.15 mg/capsule), monacolin K (lovastatin) (0.10-10.09 mg/capsule), and monacolin KA (0.00-2.30 mg/capsule). Four products had elevated levels of citrinin. Conclusions: We found striking variability in monacolin content in 12 proprietary RYR products and the presence of citrinin in one-third of the formulations tested. Although RYR may have potential as an alternative lipid-lowering agent, our findings suggest the need for improved standardization of RYR products and product labeling. Until this occurs, physicians should be cautious in recommending RYR to their patients for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. ©2010 American Medical Association.

The limits of detection ranged between 0.1 and 0.7 μg kg-1 for all analytes. The method was applied to 289 representatively drawn samples of wheat, rye and oat products. Ninety-four percent of the wheat samples (n = 130), 95% of the rye samples (n = 61) and 100% of the oat samples (n = 98) were contaminated with the type A trichothecenes T-2 and HT-2 toxin. Median levels of T-2/HT-2 (sum of the toxins) were 0.91, 0.53 and 8.2 μg kg-1, respectively. Highest levels were found in wheat bran (24 μg kg-1), rye kernels (3.1 μg kg-1) and oat flakes (85 μg kg-1). All wheat and rye samples and 75% of the oat samples were contaminated with the type B trichothecene deoxynivalenol. Median levels of this toxin were 23, 15 and 0.53 μg kg-1, respectively. Highest levels were found in wheat bran (1160 μg kg-1), rye kernels (288 μg kg-1) and oat flakes (55 μg kg-1). The type B trichothecene nivalenol was detected in 67% of the wheat samples, in 3% of the rye samples and in 24% of the oat samples with highest levels in wheat bran (96 μg kg-1), rye kernels (1.8 μg kg-1) and in oat flakes (17 μg kg-1), respectively. Levels of other type A and B trichothecenes played a minor role, although the rates of contamination were often high. Neither macrocyclic type D trichothecenes (satratoxin G and H, verrucarin A, roridin A) nor diacetylverrucarol and verrucarol (type A trichothecenes), were detected in any of the samples. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

It is well known that long-term use of As-contaminated irrigation water adds As to soils and edible plants to adversely affect food production and quality. Consolidated evidence shows that As uptake in edible plants and crops is proportionally associated with the presence of high As in soils and irrigation waters. However, factors such as cultivation method, As speciation, soil composition, origin, and type of plant have major impact on the amount of As uptake. When As is absorbed by crops and edible plants, this may add substantially to the dietary As intake, thus posing human health risks to local inhabitants and to places where the As-contaminated food is exported. To date, limited attention has been paid to the risk of consumption of As-contaminated foods. In this context, our aim was to review As uptake in some of the common and popular cereals that have been a cause of human health risk. We also reviewed possible mitigation options and what needs to be done in the future. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a contaminant present in food, especially in rice and rice-based products. Toxicity of arsenic compounds (As) depends on species and oxidative state. iAs species, such as arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)), are more bioactive and toxic than organic arsenic species, like methylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) or arsenosugars and arsenobetaine. An ion chromatography-inductively coupled-plasma-mass spectroscopy method was developed to separate the four following arsenic anions: As(III), As(V), MMA(V) and DMA(V). Sample preparation was done in mild acidic conditions to ensure species preservation. The predominant arsenic species found in rice and rice-based products, except for rice drinks, was As(III), with 60–80% of the total As content, followed by DMA(V) and As(V). MMA(V) was measured only at low levels (<3%). Analyses of rice products (N = 105) intended for toddlers, including special products destined for infants and toddlers, such as dry form baby foods (N = 12) or ready-to-use form (N = 9), were done. It was found in this study that there is little or no margin of exposure. Risk assessment, using the occurrence data and indicated intake scenarios compared to reference BMDLs as established by EFSA, demonstrated toddlers with a high consumption of rice based cereals and rice drinks are at risk of high iAs exposure, for which a potential health risk cannot be excluded. © 2018, © 2018 Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, Switzerland.

The current study discusses the distribution of trace elements Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb in Asian rice-derived food products. Three types of food products, rice noodles, rice vinegar/wine, and rice snacks, were chosen for examination. Most toxic heavy metals and metalloid such as As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were found to be within the safe level of EPA. Since rice vinegar/wine is not the staple food for people, there is no noticeable safety concern. Rice noodles and snacks are consumed with noticeable Se content and they are possible for human Se source addition. With comparison with raw rice, rice-derived food products showed better quality in terms of toxic heavy metals and metalloids. This study is for the first time reporting a thorough understanding of safety concern of rice-derived food products. It provides baselines and understanding on current levels of trace elements and heavy metals in Asian-derived rice products as affected by food processes. It would also help consumers build up confidence on the food safety of Asian rice products. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Background: Known as one of the most poisonous mycotoxins, ochratoxin A (OTA) currently tops the challenges posed to clinical medicine and food hygiene in the world. OTA is increasingly albeit silently threatening public health and hygiene in all societies. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA under Group 2B of human carcinogens. The present study was conducted due to the significance of OTA health risks, particularly acute nephrotoxin in humans, and WHO-FAO proposals for a regular monitoring of OTA in rice. Materials and methods: For this purpose, 220 samples from 10 categories of rice (homegrown and imported) consumed in Mazandaran Province were taken through simple random sampling. The percentage of OTA contamination was measured in ng/g by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Data analysis was conducted based on eight statistical tests. Results: The percentage of contamination was measured at 20.45 in domestically grown rice and 13.63 in imported rice. In all samples together, the percentage was 17.73. An average OTA contamination of 3.51% (ng/g) and OTA frequency of 78.6% (ng/g) were detected in all rice samples. The OTA contamination range in all samples varied between unidentifiable levels to 110.91 ng/g. In 6% of the samples, OTA concentration of above 5 ng/g was observed. In 21.4% of Iranian rice samples, this concentration was below the limits set by Iran and European Union standards. The level of contamination in both Iranian and imported rice was not seen to exceed the standard 5% level (P>0.05). OTA contamination was significantly different in Iranian and imported rice categories (P<0.05), but the difference in OTA contamination in the Iranian and imported rice was not significant (p>0.05). The level of OTA contamination was diagnosed to be within limits in both Iranian and foreign samples of rice. Conclusion: The level of OTA contamination in the Iranian rice samples was significantly 0.72% (ng/g) higher than in the imported rice samples. In terms of OTA contamination, no significant difference was seen between the Iranian and imported rice samples.

Analysis methods of ICP-AES and HG-AFS were used to determine content of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Hg and As in rice flesh and hull samples. According to relative national standards of China and human health risk assessment, pollution and safety of rice flesh and hull in study area were evaluated. There was an identity between the sequence of heavy metals in rice flesh and hull of 10 study towns, and the distribution characteristics of some metals in rice flesh and hull of these towns were different. Some heavy metals in rice flesh were correlated with them in hull, especially Cu, Zn and Ni. Pb, Hg, As and Cd in some rice flesh were above the national standards when evaluated with single factor index method. Pb exceeded the standard seriously by 29.7%, followed with Hg (20.6%). As and Pb in some hull were above the national standards, they exceeded their standards by 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. The composite pollution indexes of rice flesh ranged from 0.30 to 3.50, and 28.4% of them were contaminated with metals. The highest arithmetical mean composite pollution index (1.42) was found in Xingang town, which could be categorized as light pollution. However, other towns could be regarded as no pollution from the means of them. The composite pollution indexes of hull ranged from 0.15 to 2.46, and 3.2% of them were polluted. From the means all towns were in security. Results of exposure risk assessment for the rice flesh suggesting that rice grown in Changshu posed Cu and Zn potential risk to food safety and rice from some towns possessed Pb potential risk.},

   abstract = {High concentrations of the mycotoxins HT-2 and T-2 (HT2 + T2), primarily produced by Fusarium langsethiae, have occasionally been detected in Norwegian oat grains. In this study, we identified weather variables influencing accumulation of HT2 + T2 in Norwegian oat grains. Oat grain samples from farmers’ fields were collected together with weather data (2004–2013). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the HT2 + T2 contamination in oats at harvest and a range of weather summarisations within estimated phenological windows of growth stages in oats (tillering, flowering etc.). Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to predict the risk of HT2 + T2 in oat grains. Our data show that adequate predictions of the risk of HT2 + T2 in oat grains at harvest can be achieved, based upon weather data observed during the growing season. Humid and cool conditions, in addition to moderate temperatures during booting, were associated with increased HT2 + T2 accumulation in harvested oat grains, whereas warm and humid weather during stem elongation and inflorescence emergence, or cool weather and absence of rain during booting reduced the risk of HT2 + T2 accumulation. Warm and humid weather immediately after flowering increased the risk, while moderate to warm temperatures and absence of rain during dough development, reduced the risk of HT2 + T2 accumulation in oat grains. Our data indicated that HT2 + T2 contamination in oats is influenced by weather conditions both pre- and post-flowering. These findings are in contrast with a previous study examining the risk of deoxynivalenol contamination in oat reporting that toxin accumulation was mostly influenced by weather conditions from flowering onwards. © 2018, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Rice is one of the most important staple foods worldwide. Soil contamination with heavy metals and food safety problems occur in many countries as a result of numerous human activities, particularly wastewater and solid waste disposal. This review paper provides a schematic summary of heavy metals in identification processes, transport in soil to different rice varieties, and soil remediation strategies and techniques surrounding the agro-environmental impact in paddy soils based on a description of Taiwan's experiences and database. In terms of the soil control standard, heavy metals including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn are regulated by the Soil and Ground Water Pollution Remediation Act of Taiwan. Owing to the heavy metal source from wastewater along irrigation systems, heavy metals not only accumulate in the surface soil (0-30 cm), but are also highly distributed at the main entrance of irrigation water into individual paddy fields. Moreover, sediments in the irrigation canal have to be dredged and the irrigation system needs to be isolated from the discharge system of wastewater to maintain soil quality. Cadmium in rice grains accumulates more significantly in Indica varieties than in Japonica varieties, and this accumulation exceeds the food quality standard. The best well-performing metal uptake models have been developed to predict Cd levels in rice grains for Indica and Japonica varieties using soil bioavailable Cd and Zn concentrations extracted by 0.01 mol L-1 CaCl2. Soil remediation techniques, including turnover and dilution, in situ stabilization by chemical amendments and phytoremediation, have been tested and recommended in Taiwan. Although the high background levels of As, Cr and Ni, which were higher the soil control standard in some paddy soils, are derived from andesite and serpentinites in Taiwan, rice quality and yield were not adversely affected by these metals when labile concentrations were very low. Overall, it is necessary to identify the bioavailability of heavy metals in different soil types from specific case studies to provide reliable parameters for health-based risk assessments and to further achieve the goal of food safety and sustainable agriculture. © 2010 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

   abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a food safety concern worldwide due to its high toxicity, particularly in rice, which accumulates As more easily than other crops. Accordingly, low-cost, simple methods are needed for accurate determination of iAs in food crops. We extracted total arsenic (As) from rice using HNO3 and then reduced arsenate (As5+) to arsenite (As3+) using thiourea. The combined As3+ was separated from organic As using polystyrene resin cartridges, and quantified by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). This method achieved 1.1 μg kg-1 limit of detection, 3.6 μg kg-1 limit of qualification, and &lt;6% relative standard deviation. Validation was performed using certified reference materials and conventional high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICPMS). Compared with LC-HG-AFS or LC-ICPMS, this method appears suitable for general use because of its low cost. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

According to the exposure assessment method of probabilistic simulation, all values of the target hazard quotients (THQs) for chronic noncarcinogenic risks (skin lesions as the point of departure) were below 1, suggesting that the Chinese population will not encounter a significant noncarcinogenic risk. However, the mean values of margin of exposure (MOE) for lung cancer risks ranging from 3.86 to 8.54 were under 100 for all age groups and genders of the Chinese population; moreover, MOE values for some major rice-producing and -consuming countries, such as Japan, Thailand, Bangladesh, and the United States, were all also below 100. More attention should be paid to carcinogenic risks from rice Asi intake, and some control measures to reduce rice Asi intake should be taken. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by specific filamentous fungi that are common contaminants of agricultural commodities. These compounds are toxic to humans and animals, and they are a health problem worldwide. Mycotoxin-containing feeds can cause serious diseases in farm animals and substantial economic losses. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and levels of six mycotoxins in three types of forage at retail in the state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The hypothesis was that all types of forages were contaminated with at least one of the six mycotoxins analyzed. One hundred and twenty samples of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) used for animal consumption were collected from farms and commercial locations in the state of Nuevo Leon, from June to November 2013, and January 2014. The total concentrations of aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, ochratoxin, T-2/HT-2 toxins, and zearalenone were determined by enzyme linked immunoassays using Neogen Veratox mycotoxin test kits. For data analysis, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. All forage types contained mycotoxins, although the alfalfa samples showed higher mean levels of aflatoxins (2.77 fig kg(-1)), deoxinivalenol (470 mg kg(-1)), ochratoxin (32.7 mu g kg(-1)), T-2/HT-2 toxins (93.7 mu g kg(-1)), and zearalenone (199.6 mu g kg(-1)). Most samples were contaminated with more than two mycotoxins, which could be a risk for animal and human health. These data showed the need to establish appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of feed contamination, particularly when mixtures with forage susceptible to fungal contamination are used for feeding livestock.},

This study was performed to determine the occurrence and determinants of aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in rice and maize and to assess health risks through dietary intake exposure among ethnic minority groups in northern Vietnam. A total of 111 rice and 102 maize samples, were tested for occurrence of fungi and mycotoxins, i.e. aflatoxins (AF's) and fuminisin B (FB). Results showed that 107 (96.4%) rice and 84 (82.4%) maize samples were contaminated by fungi. Aspergillus flavus was found in 68 (61.3%) rice and 30 (29.4%) maize samples, Aspergilus parasiticus in 40 (36.0%) rice and 27 (26.7%) maize samples. AF's - were detected in 27 rice (24.3%) and 27 maize samples (26.4%) at minimum and maximum levels in rice of 2.06 and 77.8 ng/g and 20.5 and 110 ng/g in maize, respectively. Nine (8.1%) rice and 24 (23.5%) maize samples contained FB at ranges of 2.3-624 ng/g in rice and 5.6-89.8 ng/g in maize. Data collected through interviews and observations in households showed that type of crop, storage duration and presence of fungi, particularly mycotoxigenic fungi were important risk factors for AF's and FB contamination. Based on daily food consumption data, the estimated average exposure dose of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) from rice was 21.7 ng/kg bw/day for adults and 33.7 ng/kg bw/day for children. For FB, the rice based average exposure amounted to 536 ng/kg bw/day for adults and 1019 ng/kg bw/day for children. The calculated excess risk of liver cancer incidence by ingestion of cereals containing AFB1 was 1.5 per 100,000 adults and 2.3 per 100,000 children per year. The average intake of FB was calculated to be lower than the tolerable diet intake (TDI). Our findings highlight that rice and maize are contaminated with mycotoxins at levels representing actual health hazards for the ethnic minority groups consuming these stable cereals. Proper drying and storage conditions in households are likely to reduce the mycotoxin contamination. © 2016 .},

The results indicated that 80% of the samples presented detectable, although very low levels, of two or more mycotoxins.

In general, the statistical study did not show significant differences between levels or incidence for the mycotoxins in different years of harvest, variety of barley, farming or origin. The calculated values for daily intake were low and the risk to consumers could be assumed to be very low. However, the co-occurrence of several mycotoxins, and therefore synergic or additive effects, should be taken into account when determining permitted levels or risk assessment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The procedure included simultaneous extraction of trichothecenes with acetonitrile and water (84:16), clean up with Multisep columns, derivatization of the extract and GC-MS analysis. During method validation, selectivity, linearity, precision and accuracy, limits of detection and quantification and recovery were evaluated. Recovery ranged from 92.0 to 101.9% (RSD < 15%), except for nivalenol (NIV) (63.1%), and the limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0.31 to 3.87 mu g kg(-1) and from 10 to 20 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The higher occurrence was found for deoxynivalenol (DON) (89% of the samples), although at concentrations below the maximum permitted level. The calculated dietary intakes of DON, NIV and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 were below the TDI values proposed. Two or more trichothecenes were present in 41% of the samples and so, the mycotoxin co-occurrence, and therefore synergic or additive effects, should be taking into account when determining permitted levels or risk assessment.

The parent as well as the metabolite in rice and rice straw were extracted and analysed under the same conditions. A correlation coefficient (R2) of &gt;0.994 was obtained for matrix-matched calibration curves constructed in various concentration ranges. Recoveries at two fortification levels were satisfactory and ranged between 75.4% and 118.9% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) &lt; 13%. Under storage conditions (-20 °C), the analyte and its metabolite were stable for up to 92 days. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) were lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL) (0.1 mg/kg) set by the Korea Food and Drug Administration for brown rice. Field trials with recommended or double the recommended dose revealed that the herbicide could safely be applied to rice and rice straw, as no residues were detected in the harvested samples.

A total of 413 rice samples (paddy 58, parboiled 69, brown 84, white 93, and broken 109) were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detector. The results showed that 64 % paddy (16.35±1.67 μg/kg), 38 % parboiled (14.20±2.04 μg/kg), 33 % brown (9.85±1.25 μg/kg), 42 % white (7.10±1.39 μg/kg), and 50 % broken (8.5±1.71 μg/kg) rice samples were contaminated with aflatoxins. It was found that paddy rice was most contaminated with aflatoxins while white rice was least contaminated. The percentage of samples exceeding EU maximum contents for total aflatoxins in rice (4 μg/kg) varied from 14 to 36 % when compared to the analyzed rice fractions. The total estimated amount of aflatoxin intake for average rice consumers ranged from 19.1 to 26.6 ng/kg body weight/day, much higher than the reference value of 1 ng/kg body weight/day. This is the first report discovering that rice is a major contributor to the dietary intake of aflatoxins in Pakistan. © Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer 2012.},

The present study determined the levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr) in 71 irrigated and rain-fed rice and assessed dietary (rice) exposure to the heavy metals. The concentration in rice grains were generally higher in the irrigated season which may be related to the use of contaminated irrigation water: As 0.153 ± 0.112 and 0.140 ± 0.080 mg kg-1, Cd 0.073 ± 0.069 and 0.038 ± 0.032 mg kg-1, Pb 0.264 ± 0.125 and 0.147 ± 0.077 mg kg-1 and Cr 1.208 ± 0.913 and 0.986 ± 0.796 mg kg-1 in irrigated and rain-fed rice, respectively. Elevated concentration of grain As was recorded for rice samples that were collected from the locations with As-contaminated groundwater used for irrigation. For Cd, Pb and Cr, relatively higher concentration was noted for the areas which could be linked to industrial effluent contamination. Daily intake of As and heavy metals from rice is estimated as 18.6-214 μg for As, 2.6-119 μg for Cd, 25.0-241 μg for Pb and 59.0-1846 μg for Cr, based on 400g daily rice consumption for 60 kg Bangladeshi adult people. The rice component of the diet alone may contribute up to 46%, 57%, 50% and 60% of the Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (MTDI) for As, Cd, Pb and Cr, respectively, making it a more important factor in the dietary intake for these elements than other food stuffs and drinking water. Hence, heavy metals accumulation in rice grains is a big concern in south Asia where people's daily meal largely contains rice or rice based products.},

Tropical weather, poor agricultural practices, poor storage conditions and little knowledge on mycotoxins exposes sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) community at high risk of mycotoxin. Studies in SSA demonstrated that, maize grains are infested by toxigenic fungi and contaminated with mycotoxins to varying degree. Mycotoxins frequent occurring in maize include; aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, ochratoxins and zearalenone. Their effect can be acute and/or chronic leading to health problems such as; liver cancer, immunosuppression, irritation, and respiratory problem among others. Local practices, maize seems to be less contaminated are used for human consumption while those unfit for human are used as feeds exposing human health at high risk of mycotoxins toxicity. It is important for sub-Sahara Africa countries to invest in infrastructures and enforce practices which leads to prevention and control of mycotoxins in maize before they become real risks. Also, interventions on public awareness on the effect of mycotoxins to human health should be promoted to guarantee safe maize and maize products. In this review, mycotoxins occurrence, incidences, prevention, control, decontamination and inactivation in maize are scrutinized and presented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A total of 180 wheat samples were obtained from the infected fields that spread 21 counties. DON and ZEN levels were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). DON was found in 74.4% of samples at levels ranging from 14.52 to 41157.13 μg/kg (mean 488.02 μg/kg), while ZEN was found in 12.8% of samples at levels ranging from 10.13 to 3048.88 μg/kg (mean 73.04 μg/kg). In years and regions of higher rainfall, DON and ZEN levels were higher in samples.

Optimized methods using immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up coupled with UV detection were applied. DON was detected in 87.5% (12.5–1920.4 μg/kg) of samples, and 10.5% of tested samples exceeded the legal limit for DON in China (1000 μg/kg). DON was found in 100% of whole wheat flour (51.6–1308.9 μg/kg), Chinese steamed bread (54.5–845.4 μg/kg), and biscuit (40.9–1920.4 μg/kg), samples, and in 85.3% of all-purpose flour (12.5–1285.4 μg/kg), 73.3% of maize flour (26.4–138.2 μg/kg), and 60.0% of oat flake samples (16.8–243.6 μg/kg), with 426.0, 293.0, 419.2, 455.7, 55.4, and 44.0 μg/kg, respectively, representing the mean levels in these products. A chronic intake assessment indicated that estimated daily intake (EDI) of DON through the consumption of wheat flour was 1.0–3.8 and 3.1–11.3 times that of the Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTDI) of 1.0 μg/kg body weight/day for adults and children, respectively, at different levels. The EDIs of DON consumed through wheat flour-derived products (Chinese steamed bread and biscuits) for children was 1.7–12.7 times those of the PMTDI at different levels, whereas the EDIs obtained through consumption of maize flour and oat flakes were 0.2 times lower than those of the PMTDI for both adults and children. In a dietary exposure assessment, the acute hazard indexes (aHI) for adults and children were above 100% of Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 8.0 μg/kg body weight/day) through the consumption of wheat flour, Chinese steamed bread, and biscuits, and the aHIs were only 16.4% (31.2%) and 5.1% (8.3%) of ARfD for adults (children). Among the cereal-based food products analyzed, both chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term) dietary exposure assessments for DON consumption by adults and children indicated that wheat flour (all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour), Chinese steamed bread, and biscuits have become sources of potential health hazards in the human diet in China. The risk associated with DON contamination in maize flour and oat flakes should also not be ignored. © 2018},

From the 468 samples of wheat kernel, collected at preharvest stage from different locations during 2008 and 2009 cultivation seasons, 3,260 fungi strains were isolated with 49.4% belonging to Penicillium spp. and 31.2% belonging to Aspergillus spp. Penicillium spp. was detected on wheat samples with a high amount of P. verrucosum (37.0%). Among the different Aspergillus spp. isolated, A. niger aggregate was predominant and constituted 37.3%. whereas the isolation rate of A. flavus and A. ochraceus was 32.2 and 25.6%, respectively. The ability to produce OTA and AFB1 by isolates belonging to Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). It was found that 57.0% of Penicillium spp. and 80% of A. ochraceus isolates tested produced OTA, respectively, at maximum concentrations of 53 and 65 μg/g CYA. As for the aflatoxinogenic ability, 45.3% of A. flavus produced AFB1, with maximum concentration of 40 μg/g CYA. A total of 156 wheat samples were analyzed for the levels of OTA and AFB1 by HPLC-FLD. The results showed that 23.7% were contaminated with OTA, at a concentration higher than 3 μg/kg and 35.2% of these samples were contaminated with AFB1 at concentration higher than 2 μg/kg. The risks originating from toxin levels in wheat produced in Lebanon should be monitored to prevent their harmful effects on public health. © 2011 Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer.},

Subsequently to evaluate the risk exposure of Italian population and infant population over the consumption of pasta or multicereal baby food, was, respectively, evaluated. For the above mentioned evaluation, a method developed in our laboratory by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used. A liquid phase dispersion procedure was optimised for the simultaneous extraction of BEA and the five ENs from multicereal baby food samples and pasta. The main parameters affecting extraction yield and selectivity, extraction solvent were evaluated. The method was validated by analysis for pasta and multicereal baby food samples fortified at different concentration levels (from 0.5 to 20 μg/kg). Average recoveries (n = 5) ranged from 85% to 99% with relative standard deviation lower than 13%. Limits of quantification (LQs) for both matrices ranged from 1 to 10 μg/kg. Analytical results showed that the occurrence of BEA, ENA, ENA1, ENB, ENB1 and ENB4 in analysed pasta and multicereal baby food samples were below 68% and 74%, respectively. ENB was the mycotoxin most found and levels in pasta and baby food ranged from <LQ to 106 and from <LQ to 1100 μg/kg, respectively. It was observed a high incidence (70.3%) and high contamination levels (<1100 μg/kg) of these mycotoxins in multicereal baby food and its intakes could represent a risk for the infant population (estimated daily intake <7.23 μg/kg bw/day). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is among the most important mycotoxins, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies it as possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). A total of 61 samples of bread from the central zone of Portugal were analysed for OTA by liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection (FD). For confirmation two procedures were applied, methyl ester derivatization with boron trifluoride-methanol and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS). As far as we know, this is the first report where on-line LC/electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used for OTA analysis in bread. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.015 and 0.03 ng/g, using LC-FD, and 0.03 and 0.09 ng/g by LC-MS/MS. The incidence of OTA was 12.9% and 70.0% for wheat and maize bread, respectively. The highest OTA levels were obtained for maize bread, having one sample exceeded the European maximum limit established for OTA in cereal products.

The identification of OTA in positive rice samples was confirmed by methyl ester derivatization. Analytical results showed a frequency of contamination of 26% of total analyzed rice samples. The percentage of contamination of samples was 24, 26.6, 16.6, 27.7 and 30% in Rabat, Témara, Méknès, Salé and Casablanca respectively. Levels of OTA in positive samples ranged between 0.08 and 47 ng/g. The average contamination of all analyzed samples was 3.5 ng/g. The highest frequency of positive samples (30%) and the most contaminated sample (47 ng/g) was found in a sample from Casablanca city. 14 out of 100 total samples exceeded the maximum level of 5 ng/g set by European regulations for OTA in cereals. Based in the results presented in this study, the estimated daily intake of OTA in rice was 0.32 ng/kg bw/day for Moroccan consumers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A fast acoustic screening method in combination with an ELISA method was applied for the detection of deoxynivalenol (DON) in co-occurrence with some trichothecenes such as zearalenone (ZEA) and T-2/HT-2 toxins in winter wheat grains (Triticum aestivum L.) of the most popular Lithuanian cultivar Sirvinta. Strong correlations between the amplitude of the acoustic signal that penetrated the wheat samples and DON as well as total amount of mentioned trichothecenes quantified by ELISA method were found (R2=0.787 and R 2=0.794, respectively). It turned out that weak correlations between the acoustic signal and the concentrations of ZEA and T-2/HT-2 were found. These correlations suggest that DON is the marker of the Fusarium infected wheat grain. This statement is also strengthened by the fact that DON is the most significant trichothecene contaminant of cereal grains in the world and levels are generally higher in the wetter climates. The dependency determined between the acoustic signal and structural physical characteristics (1000-kernel-weight) of the grain matrix could therefore be the basis for the developed rapid acoustic method for cereal quality and safety control. Additional examination of microstructure of wholesome and Fusarium-affected kernels under the scanning electron microscope revealed that obvious damage to the starch granules and lack of protein matrix was caused by the increase in several enzyme activities in the infected grains. Moderate positive relationships between α-amylase, protease and xylanase activities, and the degree of Fusarium infection were found (for α-amylase R2=0.623, for protease R 2=0.823, and for xylanase R2=0.682). An intriguing characterisation may contribute to explanations as to how and to what extent wheat starch granules of different sizes stay more or less intact by slightly infected grains while the wheat starch granules are damaged and/ or completely destroyed by seriously infected grains. The changes of the protease activity had a slightly detectable influence on the crude protein content in seriously infected grain samples which might have an effect on dough properties and the quality of bread. © 2011 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxin occurs ubiquitously in maize and is both an economic and a public health concern due to its carcinogenic effects. Nevertheless, in developing countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is still a dearth of information regarding its natural occurrence, exposure to both humans and animals and strategies for controlling its proliferation or contamination of food crops such as maize. The present study comparatively assessed the aflatoxin occurrence in maize samples collected in the DRC throughout the food supply chain. The analytical method used during this experiment was found to be accurate with a recovery ranging between 70.65 and 98.20%, and also precise (RSD&lt;15%) except for AFG1, which showed an RSD of 18.05%. Moreover, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for aflatoxin ranged from 0.31 to 0.69 μg/kg and from 1 to 2 μg/kg, respectively. The results also revealed that in the pre-harvest period, 32% of maize samples (out of a total of 50) were positive, with aflatoxins at a range of 1.5-51.23 μg/kg for AFB1 and 3.1-103.89 μg/kg for total aflatoxin. As the supply chain progresses, the contamination of maize samples also increases, with 100% of the collected maize samples found to contain aflatoxins at 300 times higher than the maximum limit of 10 μg/kg for total aflatoxin as set by the WHO. The aflatoxin content of maize samples was found to increase drastically at up to 500 times between the city store and the distribution system at market level. This was confirmed with a statistical analysis showing a significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) between city store/market samples and pre-harvest, harvest, farm store and after-transportation samples. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins and fumonisins are two mycotoxins that are prevalent in cereals. Both toxins have associated and causal health effects in humans and livestock. Once formed in the substrates, the toxins are not easily destroyed. The preferred mitigation is to prevent contamination of the cereals and animal source foods. In this paper we set out to examine the practices of the farmers in two counties (Nandi and Makueni) in Kenya which exacerbates aflatoxin contamination and the government steps to address the issue in the agriculture and livestock sectors. The practices identified in Nandi and Makueni, respectively, included seed varieties where 19.3% and 56% are using local varieties; use of soil amendments where 5.8% and 181 % are not using any amendments; crop rotation where 54.6% and 60.5% are not practicing crop rotation; 22.7% and 37.5% are using wrong drying methods; and 53% and 77.1% are using poor threshing methods. The Kenya government is subsidizing fertilizers, seeds, increasing areas under irrigation, and providing extension services to build capacity of farmers to mitigate aflatoxin contamination. The paper examines also the cultural practices in land preparation, tillage, crop rotation, drying, sorting at farm, and proper storage as better alternative practices for easy adoption that would, if adopted, lead to a decrease in aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination and therefore reduce household exposure. Good agricultural practices should be a prerequisite for the adoption of other aflatoxin control technologies.},

Cd concentrations in more than 18 % of rice samples exceeded the maximum allowable Cd concentration, and the highest level of 41.1 % was observed in samples from Hezhang, Guizhou, which was characterized by serious Cd pollution. Target hazard quotient (THQ) values of 1.5 to 7.8 from rice intake indicated a significant non-carcinogenic health risk for humans, particularly for highly exposed consumers. Children are more at risk than adults, as indicated by the higher THQs. Moreover, carcinogenic risks of Cd from rice intake for average and high consumers in the selected areas were two to three and four to eight greater, respectively, than the threshold value recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.},

   abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to determine total fungal counts and the relative density of Aspergillus fumigatus and related species in silage samples intended for bovines before and after fermentation as well as to monitor the natural occurrence of gliotoxin in silage samples (pre- and postfermentation). Methods and methods: The survey was performed in farms located in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States in Brazil. In addition, the ability of A. fumigatus strains and related species strains to produce gliotoxin was also evaluated. A total of 300 samples were taken, immediately after opening of the silo (3-5 months) and during the ensiling period. Fungal counts were done by the surface-spread method. Gliotoxin production ability of isolates and natural contamination were determined by HPLC. Results: All postfermented samples had a total number of moulds exceeding 1 × 10 4 CFU g -1, with Aspergillus sp. as the most prevalent genus. Frequency of strains, among A. fumigatus and related species, was able to produce gliotoxin was similar in pre- and postfermented samples, except for sorghum, which showed differences between both kinds of samples. The highest toxin levels were produced by strains isolated from postfermented samples. More than 50% of the samples showed gliotoxin contamination levels that exceeded concentrations known to induce immunosuppressive and apoptotic effects in cells. Conclusions: The present data suggest that care should be taken because gliotoxin contamination in feedstuffs could affect productivity and also present a health risk for herds. Significance and Impact of the Study: Gliotoxin was found at quite important concentrations levels in pre- and postfermented substrates and its presence could therefore probably affect the productivity and health of herds. Current conservation and management practices do not avoid contamination with A. fumigatus on silage. Therefore, farm workers should be adequately protected during its handling. © 2012 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: One-hundred and fifty different fresh and stored rice samples were collected from 30 different zones of the Mazandaran province, Iran between August 2010 and November 2011. After sterilization, the grains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing chloramphenicol (100 mg/L) at 27°C for 7-10 days. All Fusarium isolates were sub-cultured on PDA, SpeziellerNährstofarmer agar (SNA) and carnation leaf agar (CLA). FB1 was extracted with acetonitrile: water (50: 50, v/v) solution and detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis using a fuorescence detector (excitation: 229 nm; emission: 442 nm).Results: Mycofora profles of fresh and stored rice grains showed that Aspergillus species (37.3%, 40.7%) were the predominant fungal agents, followed by Fusarium (21.6%, 16.2%), Mucor (19.6%, 16.7%) and Rhizopus (9.8%, 11.1%), respectively. In HPLC analysis, most of the rice samples (96.7%) collected were found to be positive for FB1 with mean levels ranging from not detected to 56.2 mg/kg for fresh samples and from 4.3 to 42.8 mg/kg for stored ones. FB1 levels varied from one zone to another and throughout the storage time, showing a decreasing trend in most zones. Conclusions: Rice samples with a high prevalence of diverse species of toxigenic fungi, in particular Aspergillus and Fusarium species, and high levels of FB1 in many samples indicate the need for proper surveillance and monitoring exclusively for the prevention of fungi and FB1 in rice produced in Mazandaran province before it reaches the consumer. © 2013, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences; Licensee Kowsar Ltd.},

The material covered by the study were samples of corn flour, corn grits, corn flakes, products for infants and young children, popcorn and samples of corn grain. In these samples the total amount of fumonisins as well as separately fumonisin B1 and B2 were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a fluorescence detector prior to the derivatization. Of the 106 surveyed corn foods samples, more than 1/3 (34.9%) were found contaminated by fumonisins B1 and B2; Fumonisin B1 was present in 45.3% of samples, and Fumonisin B2 in 17.0% of the samples. One sample of corn flour was found contaminated by fumonisins on the level of 6342 mg/kg, what makes that the maximum permissible level has been exceeded of more than three times. In other food products, the maximum permissible level of fumonisin was not exceeded. Exposure to mycotoxins in the analyzed corn food products is not a significant health risk to consumers. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Results obtained from a purity study on standards of the 6 major ergot alkaloids ergometrine, ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, and ergocornine and their corresponding epimers are discussed. The 6 ergot alkaloids studied have been defined by the European Food Safety Authority as those that are the most common and physiologically active. The purity of the standards was investigated by means of liquid chromatography with diode array detection, electrospray ionization, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-TOF-MS). All of the standards assessed showed purity levels considerably above 98% apart from ergocristinine (94%), ergosine (96%), and ergosinine (95%). Also discussed is the optimization of extraction conditions presented in a recently published method for the quantitation of ergot alkaloids in food samples using solid-phase extraction with primary secondary amine (PSA) before LC/MS/MS. Based on the results obtained from these optimization studies, a mixture of acetonitrile with ammonium carbonate buffer was used as extraction solvent, as recoveries for all analyzed ergot alkaloids were significantly higher than those with the other solvents. Different sample-solvent ratios and extraction times showed just minor influences in extraction efficacy. Finally, the stability of the ergot alkaloids in both raw cereals and cereal-based processed food extracts was studied. According to these studies, extracts should be prepared and analyzed the same day or stored below ambient temperatures. Barley and rye extracts, which were stored at 4 and 15°C after PSA cleanup, proved to be stable overnight. However, storage over a period of 14 days at 4°C resulted in significant epimerization, which was most pronounced in rye and particularly for ergocornine, ergocryptine, and ergocristine.},

The six ergot alkaloids studied have been defined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as among the most common and physiologically active ones. In addition, the method enables the quantification of the corresponding six epimers (ergo-inines) of these ergot alkaloids. This is of considerable importance in terms of the differences in toxicity of the isomeric forms. The method involves extraction under alkaline conditions using a mixture of acetonitrile and ammonium carbonate buffer followed by a rapid clean-up using dispersive solid-phase extraction with PSA (primary secondary amine) and a short chromatographic LC-run (21 min) with subsequent MS-MS detection. The method was developed and validated using ten different cereal and food samples. The major strength of the new method compared with previously published techniques is the simplicity of the clean-up procedure and the short analysis time. The limits of quantification were 0.17 to 2.78 μg kg -1 depending on the analyte and matrix. Recovery values for the 12 ergot alkaloids spiked into ten different matrices at levels of 5, 50, and 100 μg kg -1 were between 69 and 105% for 85 of 90 recovery measurements made over six days. Measurement uncertainty values were highly satisfactory. At a concentration level of 5 μg kg -1 the expanded measurement uncertainty ranged from ±0.56 to ±1.49 μg kg -1, at a concentration level of 100 μg kg -1 the expanded measurement uncertainty ranged from ±8.9 to ±20 μg kg -1. Both LOQs and measurement uncertainties were dependent on the analyte but almost independent of the matrix. The method performance was satisfactory when tested in a mini-intercomparison study between three laboratories from three different countries. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

Mycotoxin levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was the most common Fusarium toxin, detected in 85% of samples, 2% of samples exceeded the maximum level set by Regulation (EC) 1881/2006. Nivalenol (NIV) was detected in 63% of samples, T-2 toxin – in 73% and HT-2 toxin – in 79%. The mean concentration of DON was 368.4 μg kg-1, for NIV – 34.8 μg kg-1, for T-2 toxin – 38.2 μg kg-1and for HT-2 toxin – 29.9 μg kg-1. Co-occurrence of DON with NIV was detected in 15.5% of positive samples and their co-occurrence with other mycotoxins represented additional 7.35%. Cooccurrence of DON with zearalenone (ZEA) was detected in 25.9% of positive samples. To prevent the occurrence of mycotoxins at levels considered harmful to human health, a number of measures are needed at different levels, from good agricultural practices, breeding for resistance, to adequate legislation, methods and programs for food control that influence food security. © 2017, Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture.

Mycotoxin contamination caused by this Fusarium species can represent a food safety hazard that deserves further attention. In the present work, the mycotoxin profile in wheat cultures of F. langsethiae is presented with particular reference to the production of major type-A trichothecenes and their glucosyl derivatives. F. langsethiae isolates, representative of the major Italian wheat cultivation areas, were tested for the production of T2, HT2, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and neosolaniol (NEO), and relevant glucosyl derivatives. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for the identification and chemical characterization of these metabolites. F. langsethiae isolates under investigation resulted to be potent producers of T2, HT2 and NEO. Furthermore, a well-defined set of isolates, all originating from Central Italy, produced also DAS. All isolates were found to be able to produce HT2 glucosyl derivatives, whereas only traces of T2 glucoside were detected in one sample. Furthermore, two mono-glucosyl derivatives of NEO and one mono-glucoside derivative of DAS were identified and characterized. The screening for the presence/absence of glucosylated trichothecenes in analyzed fungal extracts revealed a general co-occurrence of these derivatives with the parent toxin at levels that could be roughly estimated to account up to 37% of the relevant unconjugated toxin. This is the first report of the production of glucosylated trichothecenes by F. langsethiae cultured on small grains. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The average dietary intake of zearalenone from white and brown rice by the Korean population was estimated to be 1.5 ng kg−1 body weight (bw) day−1 each. For heavy consumers, the average intakes were 18.5 and 10.1 ng kg−1 bw day−1, respectively. The age groups with the highest zearalenone intake were 1–2-year-old children for white rice and 3–6-year-old children for brown rice.

   abstract = {Cereal grains and their processed food products are frequently contaminated with mycotoxins. Among many, five major mycotoxins of aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone are of significant public health concern as they can cause adverse effects in humans. Being airborne or soilborne, the cosmopolitan nature of mycotoxigenic fungi contribute to the worldwide occurrence of mycotoxins. On the basis of the global occurrence data reported during the past 10 years, the incidences and maximum levels in raw cereal grains were 55% and 1642 μg/kg for aflatoxins, 29% and 1164 μg/kg for ochratoxin A, 61% and 71,121 μg/kg for fumonisins, 58% and 41,157 μg/kg, for deoxynivalenol, and 46% and 3049 μg/kg for zearalenone. The concentrations of mycotoxins tend to be lower in processed food products; the incidences varied depending on the individual mycotoxins, possibly due to the varying stability during processing and distribution of mycotoxins. It should be noted that more than one mycotoxin, produced by a single or several fungal species, may occur in various combinations in a given sample or food. Most studies reported additive or synergistic effects, suggesting that these mixtures may pose a significant threat to public health, particularly to infants and young children. Therefore, information on the co-occurrence of mycotoxins and their interactive toxicity is summarized in this paper. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

A few limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the level of aflatoxin B1 in maize in Vietnam. In addition, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the perception and knowledge of aflatoxins in Vietnam. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the levels of aflatoxin B1 for human and animal consumption in maize and evaluate perceptions and knowledge of aflatoxins among people across the country. A total of 2,370 samples were collected from six provinces and analysed using ELISA. Among collected samples, 799 samples (33.71%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 31.81-35.66%) and 687 samples (28.98%, 95%CI: 27.17-30.86%) had levels above 2 μg/kg and 5 μg/kg, respectively [range from below limit of detection (LOD) to 34.8 μg/kg; of the samples above LOD, the mean was 13.1 μg/kg and median was 11.2 μg/kg]. A total of 551 people were interviewed from 6 provinces. The survey showed that awareness of aflatoxins (question: Have you heard about aflatoxins?) in southern Vietnam [An Giang (25%), Dak Lak (23.23%) and Dong Nai (6%)] was relatively higher than in provinces in northern Vietnam. We believe that this analysed information can be useful to better understand the epidemiology of aflatoxins in different provinces. This study also produces evidence on potential risk to humans and animals in Vietnam as well as demographic factors (such as gender and level of education) significantly influencing knowledge of aflatoxins. In conclusion, this paper points to the importance of raising the awareness of the risks with aflatoxins, bearing in mind the gender aspect during capacity development.},

   abstract = {The potential and limitation of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method was investigated to develop an accelerated spectroscopic method as an alternative analytical technique to commonly used wet chemical methods for fumonisin analysis in maize. SERS spectral difference among groups of ground maize samples with different concentrations of fumonisins more clearly reflected the level of fumonisin contamination and its effect on physicochemical properties of ground maize samples than conventional Raman spectral difference. In general, chemometric classification models exhibited moderately acceptable correct classification rates (68.0–100.0 % for training dataset and 58.8–85.3 % for validation dataset) and no or little false–negative error. The k-nearest neighbor models applied to validation dataset slightly outperformed over other classification models, showing correct classification rates of 70.6–79.4 %. Chemometric quantification models using validation dataset also yielded a good predictive power and ability, showing satisfactory regression quality (slope = 0.902–1.096), high coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.825–0.940), and low root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP = 11.162–19.954 mg/kg), with no statistical significant difference with the reference value. The multiple linear regression models showed better quality of linear regression (slope = 0.902–1.076), stronger correlation coefficient (r = 0.948–0.969), and higher predictive accuracy (r2 = 0.900–0.940) than other quantification models. The proposed SERS method would be a suitable and convenient analytical tool with a great potential for improvement in qualitative and quantitative characterization of fumonisins in maize, serving as a valuable screening tool for maize samples contaminated with fumonisins at a point of sampling. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {A total of 201 samples of brown rice, polished rice, and two types of by-products, blue-tinged rice and discolored rice, were collected from rice stores maintained at 51 rice processing complexes in Korea. These samples were analyzed for the presence of Fusarium mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEA). Contaminants (and their ranges) found in discolored rice samples were DON (59 to 1,355 ng g -1, NIV (66 to 4,180 ng g -1), and ZEA (25 to 3,305 ng g -1); those found in blue-tinged (less-ripe) rice were DON (86 to 630 ng g -1), NIV (50 to 3,607 ng g -1), and ZEA (26 to 3,156 ng g -1). Brown rice samples were contaminated mostly with NIV and ZEA (52 to 569 ng g -1 and 47 to 235 ng g -1, respectively). Polished rice samples were largely free from mycotoxins, although one sample was contaminated with NIV (77 ng g -1). When the fungal flora associated with each rice sample was investigated, blue-tinged rice was the most often contaminated with Fusarium graminearum (3.8%), followed by the discolored rice (2.4%) and brown rice (1.6%) samples. Using PCR, toxin genotyping of 266 isolates of F. graminearum revealed that most isolates (96%) were NIV producers. In conclusion, this survey is the first report of the cocontamination of Korean rice and its by-products with trichothecenes and ZEA. Importantly, it also provides new information on the natural contamination of rice by Fusarium mycotoxins. © International Association for Food Protection.},

Samples were determined using a multi-mycotoxin method based on isotope dilution ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the most frequently found mycotoxins were deoxynivalenol (DON) (97.2%), nivalenol (40.4%) and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (33.4%), and mean contamination levels in positive samples were 86.7, 3.55 and 3.34 mu gkg(-1), respectively. The obtained data were further used to estimate the daily intake of the local population, and indicated that wheat flour consumption contributes little to DON exposure. However, with the aim to keep the contamination levels under control and to establish a more precise evaluation of the mycotoxin burden in Shandong Province, more sample data from different harvest years and seasons are needed in the future.},

   abstract = {Methylmercury (MeHg) is highly toxic, and its principal target tissue in humans is the nervous system, which has made MeHg intoxication a public health concern for many decades. The general population is primarily exposed to MeHg through consumption of contaminated fish and marine mammals, but recent studies have reported high levels of MeHg in rice and confirmed that in China the main human exposure to MeHg is related to frequent rice consumption in mercury (Hg) polluted areas. This article reviews the progress in the research on MeHg accumulation in rice, human exposure and health effects, and nutrient and co-contaminant interactions. Compared with fish, rice is of poor nutritional quality and lacks specific micronutrients identified as having health benefits (e.g., n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, selenium, essential amino acids). The effects of these nutrients on the toxicity of MeHg should be better addressed in future epidemiologic and clinical studies. More emphasis should be given to assessing the health effects of low level MeHg exposure in the long term, with appropriate recommendations, as needed, to reduce MeHg exposure in the rice-eating population. © 2010 by the authors.},

On the basis of the residual results, human dietary risks were further evaluated. Chlorpyrifos residues of harvest grains were firstly prepared by QuEChERS method and analyzed using Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Dietary risks were assessed by a deterministic approach. The median residues in field trials of rice, maize and soybean were 0.617, 0.0227 and 0.0136 mg kg-1, respectively. The highest residues in field trials of rice, maize and soybean were 3.23, 0.114 and 0.102 mg kg-1, respectively. Chronic intake assessment indicated that only 39.0% of acceptable daily intake (ADI, 0-0.01mg kg bw-1day-1) was consumed through rice, maize and soybean. The acute hazard indexes (aHI) of adults was 26.1% of acute reference dose (ARfD, 0-0.1 mg kg bw-1) and aHI of children was 63.5% of ARfD in dietary exposure assessment through rice, maize and soybean consumption. Single pathway risk assessment indicated that chlorpyrifos application on field crops in manner of the good agricultural practices didn't pose public health risks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Fumonisin B1 (FB1) and Fumonisin B2 (FB2) are the most abundant and the most toxic among all the known fumonisins. The fumonisins contamination of maize has raised serious economics, food safety and human health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and contamination levels of fumonisins in maize from different areas in China. A total of 146 samples of maize were collected in 2012 after maize harvest from three provinces including Gansu, Sichuan and Guizhou in China and analyzed for FB1 and FB2 using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection following o-phthalaldehyde derivatization. The results showed that the incidence and mean levels of fumonisins (FB1+FB2) contamination for all collected maize samples were 39.7% and 497ng/g, respectively. Among the three provinces, the mean level of total fumonisins contamination of maize samples from Guizhou province was 754ng/g, which was higher than that of Sichuan (527ng/g) and Gansu (202ng/g). 3.4% of all maize samples had total fumonisins levels higher than 2000ng/g set by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and 1.4% had the levels in excess of 4000ng/g recommended by the European Commission. The possible level of fumonisins exposure for the consumers (0.08μg/kg of body weight per day) is within the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake of 2.0μg/kg of body weight per day set up by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Nevertheless, more efforts should be made to prevent and control fumonisins contamination of maize and to minimize the potential risk to health of the consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

ZEN was the most prevalent toxin, with the incidence of 27.6% (range=10.0-440.0μgkg-1), and 9.2% of the evaluated samples were contaminated with a concentration higher than that of the legislation limit of China (60μgkg-1). AFs and AFB1 were detected in 14.5% of the samples analyzed, the concentrations ranging 1.1-35.0μgkg-1 for AFs, and 1.0-32.2μgkg-1 for AFB1; 4.0% of the samples had the concentrations of AFs and AFB1 higher than that of the corresponding legislation limits of China (5.0, 10.0 and 20.0μgkg-1 for different products). OTA was detected in 14.5% of the cereal and oil products collected; the concentrations ranged 0.51-16.2μgkg-1. Only 2 samples showed OTA levels higher than that of the legislation limit of China (5.0μgkg-1). DON was detected in 7.9% of the samples; the concentrations ranged 100-700μgkg-1, and none of the samples showed DON concentration higher than that of the legislation limit of China (1.0mgkg-1). A total of 15.8% cereal and oil products were contaminated with at least two mycotoxins (multiple contaminations with different combinations including AFs-ZEN, AFs-OTA-ZEN, OTA-ZEN, ZEN-DON, OTA-ZEN-DON).

   abstract = {This study examined the total arsenic (Ast) and inorganic arsenic (Asi) content in the main rice growing area of China. The results were compared with other countries and then used for dietary exposure assessment. A total of 446 rice samples from 15 main rice-growing provinces and autonomous regions of China were collected and then divided into unpolished and polished rice. Total arsenic and arsenic species were analyzed in a total of 892 subsamples using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled ICP-MS, respectively. National Ast means were 255 μg/kg of unpolished rice and 143 μg/kg of polished rice. Asi was found to be the predominant species and mean levels were 209 μg/kg of unpolished rice and 108 μg/kg of polished rice, respectively. Exposure assessment to Asi in polished rice has been calculated for the margin of exposure (MOE), which highlights the fact that Asi levels in the Chinese rice should arouse public health concern. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Although the need for policy development on arsenic (As) in rice has been recognized and a legally enforceable maximum contaminant level (MCL) for inorganic arsenic (Asi) in rice has been established in China, evidence reported in this article indicates that the risk of exposure to As for the Chinese population through rice is still underestimated. Polished rice from various production regions of China was analyzed for total As and arsenic species using HPLC-ICPMS. Total As concentration ranged 65.3-274.2 ngg-1, with an average value of 114.4 ngg-1. Four arsenic species, including arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), were detected in most rice samples. The Asi (As(III)+As(V)) species was predominant, accounting for approximately 72% of the total As in rice, with a mean concentration of 82.0 ngg-1. In assessing the risk from As in rice, we found that As intake for the Chinese population through rice is higher than from drinking water, with a 37.6% contribution to the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI) of As recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), compared with 1.5% from drinking water. Compared to other countries, the risk for the Chinese from exposure to As through rice is more severe due to the large rice consumption in China. Therefore, not only the scientific community but also local authorities should take this risk seriously. Furthermore, more stringent legislation of the MCL for rice should be enacted to protect the Chinese consumer from a high intake of As. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

Hence, the concentrations of arsenic (As) species (AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA) were evaluated in 260 rice samples from 13 cities of Guangdong Province, the most economically dynamic provinces of China. The levels of sum concentrations of As species in rice samples varied from non-detect to 225.58 ng g−1, with an average value of 57.27 ng g−1. The mean concentrations of the major As species detected in rice samples were in the order AsIII (34.77 ng g−1) &gt; AsV (9.34 ng g−1) &gt; DMA (8.33 ng g−1) &gt; MMA (4.82 ng g−1). The rice samples of Guangdong Province were categorized as inorganic As type. Significant geographical variation of As speciation existed in rice samples of 13 cities of Guangdong Province by chi-square test (p &lt; 0.05). The average human weekly intakes of inorganic As via rice consumption in Guangdong Province, southern China, were 1.91 µg kg−1 body weight. Hazard quotients of total As via rice consumption of adults in 13 cities ranged from 0.06 to 0.30, indicating the As contents in rice from Guangdong Province had no potential adverse impact on human health. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {Wheat is often infected by Fusarium species producing mycotoxins, which may pose health risks to humans and animals. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most important Fusarium toxin in Swedish wheat and has previously been shown to be produced mainly by Fusarium graminearum. However, less is known about the co-occurrence of DON and F. graminearum with other toxins and Fusarium species in Sweden. This study examined the distribution of the most important toxigenic Fusarium species and their toxins in winter wheat (2009 and 2011) and spring wheat (2010 and 2011). DNA from seven species was quantified with qPCR and the toxin levels were quantified with a multitoxin analysis method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). The method enabled detection of many fungal metabolites, including DON, zearalenone (ZEA), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxins, moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA), and enniatins (ENNs).It was found that Fusarium poae and Fusarium avenaceum were present in almost all samples. Other common Fusarium species were F. graminearum and F. culmorum, present in more than 70% of samples. Several species occurred at lower DNA levels in 2011 than in other years, but the reverse was true for F. graminearum and Fusarium langsethiae. The most prevalent toxins were ENNs, present in 100% of samples. DON was also common, especially in spring wheat, whereas ZEA and NIV were common in 2009 and in winter wheat, but less common in 2011 and in spring wheat. Only three samples of spring wheat contained T-2 or HT-2 above LOQ. Annual mean levels of several mycotoxins were significantly lower in 2011 than in other years, but the reverse applied for DON. The strongest correlations between mycotoxin and Fusarium DNA levels were found between F. avenaceum and ENNs (r2=0.67) and MON (r2=0.62), and F. graminearum and DON (r2=0.74).These results show that several Fusarium species and toxins co-occur in wheat. The highest toxin levels were detected in spring wheat and DON and ENNs, the latter belonging to the group of so called "emerging toxins", which were the most prevalent toxins and those occurring at the highest levels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The residue levels of 16 US EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 16 selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in rice and rice hull collected from a typical e-waste recycling area in southeast China were investigated from 2005 to 2007. PAHs and OCPs also were measured in ten mollusk species (soft tissues) collected in an adjacent bay in 2007. Individual PAHs were frequently found in the entire sample set (including the rice, hull, and mollusk samples) with a detection rate of 73 %. The total concentrations of 16 PAHs (I PAHs) pound and 16 OCPs (I OCPs) pound were in the range of 40.8-432 ng/g dry weight (mean: 171 ng/g) and 2.35-925 ng/g (122 ng/g), respectively, which were comparable or higher than those reported in some polluted areas. Statistical comparisons suggested that the concentrations of contaminants in hull gradually decreased from 2005 to 2007 and the residue levels were generally in the order of mollusk, hull, and rice, on a dry weight basis. Principal component analysis in combination with diagnostic ratios implied that combustion of coal, wood, and plastic wastes that are closely associated with crude e-waste recycling activities is the main source of PAHs. The finding of decreasing trend of concentrations of PAHs in this area is consistent with the efforts of local authorities to strengthen regulations on illegal e-waste recycling activities. Composition analysis suggested that there is a recent usage or discharge of hexachlorocyclohexane and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane into the tested area. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of I PAHs pound and I OCPs pound (calculated from mean concentrations) through rice and mollusk consumption was 0.411 and 0.921 mu g/kg body weight (bw)/day, respectively.},

In addition to direct damage to crops, reduced quality and yield losses, the infected grains can accumulate mycotoxins (toxic metabolites originating from prior fungal growth), especially deoxynivalenol (DON). Wheat crops harvested in 2014/2015 in southern Brazil were affected by high levels of Fusarium head blight. In this context, the aim of this study was evaluate the mycotoxicological quality of Brazilian wheat grains and wheat products (wheat flour and wheat bran for DON. DON contamination was evaluated in 1,504 wheat and wheat product samples produced in Brazil during 2014. It was determined by high performance liquid chromatograph fitted to a mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that 1,000 (66.5%) out of the total samples tested were positive for DON. The mean level of sample contamination was 1047 μg.kg-1, but only 242 samples (16.1%) had contamination levels above the maximum permissible levels (MPL) - the maximum content allowed by current Brazilian regulation. As of 2017, MPL will be stricter. Thus, research should be conducted on DON contamination of wheat and wheat products, since wheat is a raw material widely used in the food industry, and DON can cause serious harm to public health. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

In maize flour, eight pesticides were detected and the concentrations for organochlorines, organophosphorous and pyrethroid pesticides were up to 333.3, 2220 and 2 mu g/kg, respectively. Only dieldrin was detected in cooked samples at a concentration of 2 mu g/kg. The concentrations of p,p'-DDD, aldrin, dieldrin, chlorpyrifos and pirimiphos methyl in some grains and flour samples exceeded the maximum residue limit (MRLs). The findings indicate risks and concerns for public health. Processing methods were found to cause transformation and reduction of the pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination in rice can create a health risk for the consumers. In this study, the measurement of 23 mycotoxins in rice samples (n = 180) was performed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. A food frequency questionnaire was used to get rice consumption data for the assessment of mycotoxin dietary exposure, before calculating the health risk in adults and children of north and south regions of the Pakistani Punjab province. The prevalence of aflatoxin B-1 (56%), aflatoxin B-2 (48%), nivalenol (28%), diacetoxyscirpenol (23%), fumonisin B-1 (42%), zearalenone (15%), HT-2 toxin (10%), deoxynivalenol (8%), and ochratoxin A (6%) was estimated in samples with a mean concentration range between 0.61 and 22.98 mu g/kg. Aflatoxin degradation by traditional Pakistani cooking recipes was evaluated and observed to be 41-63%. The dietary exposure to aflatoxins exceeded the tolerable daily intake at all levels, and ochratoxin A and zearalenone posed health risk at high contamination and high consumption levels. The margin of aflatoxin B-1 exposure ranged between 10 and 69 in adults and 10 and 62 in children. The mean cancer risk by aflatoxin B-1 exposure was 0.070 (adults) and 0.071 (children) cases/year/100,000 people in South Punjab population, and 0.122 (adults) and 0.127 (children) cases/year/100,000 people in North Punjab population. This study will provide new insights for the planning and management of mycotoxins in Pakistan.},

T-2 toxin was determined using TLC only. AFs were detected in all samples, at total AF concentrations of 28-372 μg/kg. OTA was found in 66.7% of the samples, also at high concentrations (134-341 μg/kg) that have to be considered as critical levels in aspects of nephrotoxicity. ZEA (53.4%), DON (23.8), FB1 (14.3%) and FB2 (4.8%) were also found in rice, although at relatively low levels. T-2 toxin was qualitatively detected by TLC in only one sample. Co-contamination with AFs, OTA, and ZEA was very common, and up to five mycotoxins were detected in a single sample. The high AF and OTA levels as found in rice in this study are regarded as unsafe, and multi-occurrences of mycotoxins in the rice samples with possible additive or synergistic toxic effects in consumers raise concern with respect to public health. © 2010 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most important diseases of barley and wheat in Brazil. The disease causes yield losses and contaminates grain with mycotoxins produced by the fungus, mainly deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). The objective of this study was to summarize the results of 16,487 analyses of DON and ZEA in barley and wheat commercial grain produced in Brazil from 2008 to 2015 using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. For barley, DON and ZEA were detected in 67% and 41% of the samples, respectively, but 19% and 18% were above the maximum tolerated limits (MTL = 1250 μg/kg for DON and 100 μg/kg for ZEA). For wheat, DON and ZEA were detected in 73 and 38% with 30% and 9% of the samples above the MTL (1250 μg/kg for DON and 200 μg/kg for ZEA). The overall mean concentration of DON was 737 μg/kg in barley and 660 μg/kg in wheat. The mean yearly DON levels varied less in barley (446 μg/kg to 1114 μg/kg) compared to wheat (346 μg/kg to 1274 μg/kg). For the latter, a high peak of DON was found in 2014 when 58% of the samples were above the MTL and the toxin levels averaged 1274 μg/kg across all samples. The mean yearly concentration of ZEA was 138 and 111 μg/kg for barley and wheat, respectively, with the highest prevalence and concentration reported in 2008 and 2009, for both crops. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive summary of DON and ZEA contamination in barley and wheat in Brazil for almost a decade of monitoring. Continuous assessment and close inspection of highly contaminated batches are essential to ensure food safety and mitigate the risk that these mycotoxins can cause to human and animal health. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Fitopatologia.},

It includes occurrence data our group previously submitted to the European Food Safety Authority and new data we gathered afterwards. A total of 1,065 samples of cereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feeding were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the presence of ergot alkaloids. The sample set included rye-, wheat-and multigrain-based food as well as rye-, wheat-and triticale-based feed. The study revealed that 59% of the analysed food and feed samples were contaminated with ergot alkaloids to some extent. In 55% of the samples, the levels of the-ine isomers were above the limit of quantification (LOQ), while contamination with the-inine isomers was found in 51% of the samples. The median values for the main ergot alkaloids (-ine forms) and the epimers (-inine forms) were 1 and 2 μg/kg, respectively. Ergot alkaloids were present in 84% of rye food, 67% of wheat food, 48% of multigrain food, 52% of rye feed, 27% of wheat feed, and 44% of triticale feed at total alkaloid levels ranging from 1 (LOQ) to 12,340 μg/kg. Though the highest frequencies of contamination were observed for food samples, the feed samples, in particular Swiss rye feed, accounted for the highest levels of ergot alkaloids. The frequencies and levels of contamination were significantly lower in organic samples compared to conventional samples. Maximum levels of individual ergot alkaloids up to 3,270 μg/kg (for ergotamine) were observed. Overall, ergosine, ergokryptine and ergocristine were the frequently occurring ergot alkaloids. The co-occurrence of all six ergot alkaloids was noted in 35% of the positive samples. Occurrence of a single ergot alkaloid was mainly observed for ergometrine.},

   abstract = {Background: Rice is a staple food for many people in the world and an important ingredient for production of food for infants and young children. According to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), cereals, primarily rice and rice products, are an important source of human exposure to inorganic arsenic, which has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as group I carcinogen. Arsenic is present in rice and rice products mainly as an inorganic form being more toxic than organic compounds Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the total and inorganic arsenic content in rice, rice-based products including food for infants and young children available on the market in Poland and thus to estimate consumer exposure to inorganic arsenic from these groups of foodstuffs Materials and Methods: A total of 62 samples of rice and rice products from trade, including a group of rice products for infants and young children, were tested. Contents of total and inorganic arsenic were determined by using hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS), after dry mineralization of samples and reduction of arsenic to arsenic hydride with sodium borohydride. To extract the inorganic arsenic forms, the samples were subjected to hydrolysis in concentrated HCl and then reduced in the presence of hydrobromic acid and hydrazine sulphate after which triple chloroform extractions and triple 1M HCl re-extractions were performed. Exposure of different groups of populations (adults and children), was estimated in relation to the Benchmark Dose Lower Confidence Limit (BMDL05) as set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) that resulted in a 0.5% increase in lung cancer (3.0 µg/kg body weight (b.w.) per day) Results: Mean content of total and inorganic arsenic in investigated rice samples was 0.12 mg/kg (median: 0.09 mg/kg; 90th percentile 0.22 mg/kg) and 0.04 mg/kg (median: 0.03 mg/kg, 90th percentile 0.07 mg/kg). Brown rice was found to be more highly contaminated with both total and inorganic arsenic than white rice. Mean contamination of brown rice with total arsenic and inorganic arsenic was: 0.18 mg/kg (median: 0.12 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.32 mg/kg) and 0.05 mg/kg (median: 0.05 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.07 mg/kg). In turn for the white rice contamination was lower, mean total arsenic content: 0.10 mg/kg (median: 0.08 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.19 mg/kg) and mean inorganic arsenic: 0.03 mg/kg (median: 0.03 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.06 mg/kg). Contamination of rice-based products both total and inorganic arsenic was similar to those reported for rice, except rice wafers (mean: 0.24 mg/kg and 0.13 mg/kg). In the group of products for infants and young children obtained results were low – mean total arsenic content was 0.06 mg/kg and inorganic arsenic 0.02 mg/kg. The estimated average adult and children’s exposure to inorganic arsenic with rice and rice products was less than 1% of the BMDL05. Intake of inorganic arsenic by 12-month-old infants with ricebased products intended for this group of population was at 6% BMDL05 Conclusions: Based on the obtained results, it was found that the content of total and inorganic arsenic in investigated samples of rice and rice products did not pose a health risk even though contamination levels in some individual samples were significant},

A total of 238 samples of rice (88 produced locally or imported), maize (79, cracked or flour) and peanut paste (71) were collected in the main markets of Abidjan, Bouaké and Korhogo. An UHPLC-MS/MS method allowed the analysis of 77 mycotoxins. All the peanut paste samples were contaminated by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) with 99% exceeding the EU limits of 2 μg kg−1 for AFB1 and 4 μg kg−1 for total aflatoxins (AFT: B1+B2+G1+G2), and concentrations reaching up to 4535 μg kg−1 (AFB1) and 8094 μg kg−1 (AFT). Maize (96%) and rice (57%) samples were also contaminated by AFB1 with 58% and 24% respectively above the EU limits and maximum levels of 80 μg kg−1 for maize and 14 μg kg−1 for rice. Only 6% of the cereal samples (3 rice and one maize samples) had ochratoxin A content above the EU limit (3 μg kg−1). Fumonisins and zearalenone were detected, respectively, in 91% and 8% of the maize samples, and in 18% and 5% of the rice samples but at levels below EU limits. Out of the 238 samples, 91% were contaminated with more than one mycotoxin including EU regulated mycotoxins and/or other mycotoxins mainly beauvericin (79% of the samples), equisetin (71%), aflatoxin M1 (45%), cyclopiazonic acid (32%), fumonisin B3 (29%), sterigmatocystin (24%), citrinin (18%), ochratoxin B (16%) and fusaric acid (15%).

   abstract = {Food safety and compliance with international standards is a major challenging to achieve food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The present study evaluated the occurrence of Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium spp., and related fungi, and resultant aflatoxins and fumonsins in dried cassava and maize samples from various markets and villages in Tanzania and Congo. The relationship between mycotoxins and length of storage period was also elucidated. The levels of aflatoxin B1 varied from 0.3 to 4.4ppb in cassava chips and flour, and from 0.1 to 13.0ppb in stored cassava samples, with relatively high levels of contamination found in cassava stored for 4 months. Maize kernels showed high aflatoxin concentrations, with means ranging from 0.04 to 120ppb. On maize, the dominant mycoflora were Aspergillus spp. (3.3%39.5%) and Fusarium spp. (42%70.5%), potentially causing serious health risks to consumers of these products. Low levels of fumonisin ranging from 0 to 0.07ppm were found in cassava chips and flour with mean values ranging from 0.001 to 0.006ppm. Maize recorded relatively higher fumonisin levels ranging from 0.02 to 9.4ppm, indicating that maize is potentially a more serious risk to consumer health than cassava. This needs to be taken into account when developing strategies to reduce toxin contamination and improve health of populations. Aflatoxin in maize is a chronic problem in the two countries surveyed, limiting marketability and income. Nevertheless the collected cassava samples are also prone to aflatoxin contamination, but not fumonisin contamination. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.},

   abstract = {A total of 125 small grain samples, including 60 of winter crop and 65 of spring crop collected during 2006-2007 at harvesting in Lithuanian fields, were involved in the current study on co-occurrence of three Fusarium mycotoxins. All grain samples tested were found to be contaminated with mycotoxins. In 2006, winter cereal grain samples contaminated with one mycotoxin accounted for 16%, and those contaminated with three mycotoxins for 25%. No spring cereal grain samples containing only one toxin were found, while those contaminated with three toxins accounted for 91% of the total samples tested. In the year 2007 winter cereal grain samples contaminated with one toxin accounted for as little as 4%, and all spring cereal grain samples tested were found to be 100% contaminated with deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and T-2 toxin. Mycotoxin concentrations in grain samples, in most cases, were within the permissible range. A trend was revealed that spring barley grain samples tested contained higher T-2 concentrations irrespective of the test year. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a result, in our experiments we chose to grow different species of cereals and to see how cereal species affect mycotoxin accumulation. This study describes the occurrence of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and T-2/HT-2 toxin in a survey of spelt and common wheat and their bran as well as flour. The analysis was conducted using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The concentrations of DON, ZEA and T-2/HT-2 in Triticum spelta and T. aestivum were influenced by species, cereal type and year interaction. The highest concentrations of these mycotoxins were found in spelt grain with glumes, in spelt glumes and in spring wheat. These results show significantly higher concentrations of Fusarium toxins in glumes than in dehulled grain, which indicates the possible protective effect of spelt wheat glumes. The lowest DON, ZEA and T-2/HT-2 concentrations were determined in spelt grain without glumes. The research shows that it is potentially risky to produce bran from grain in which mycotoxin concentrations are below limits by European Union Regulation No. 1881/2006, since the concentration of mycotoxins in bran can be several times higher than that in grain. As a result, although bran is a dietary product characterised by good digestive properties, it can become a harmful product that can cause unpredictable health damage. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Currently it is estimated that 25% of the world's harvest production is contaminated to some level with these toxins. The presence of fumonisins and deoxynivalenol in corn-based foods, available in Portugal, was analyzed in order to produce some data that may be useful for hazard characterization. A total of 105 samples were screened, including, corn meal (41), sweet corn (49) and corn flakes (15). None of the 15 samples of corn flakes contained some detectable amount of fumonisins. However, fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) contamination was found in 100.0% and 70.7% of the corn meal samples, respectively. Sweet corn samples were positive in 73.4% for FB1, although no FB2 was detected. The highest levels of fumonisin were found in corn meal (maximum: 1300 μg FB1/kg and 450 μg FB2/kg). The presence of deoxynivalenol was not detected in any of the analyzed samples. Nevertheless these results indicate the need to establish, by corn products manufacturers, a continuous monitoring program to prevent and manage the occurrence of these contaminants. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Human exposure to multiple mycotoxins constitutes an increasing health concern due to potential mycotoxins combined effects. The presence of mycotoxins mixtures in foodstuffs as cereals has been reported over the last years, but few studies are available concerning its occurrence in cereals primarily marketed for children, a particular vulnerable population group. The present study aims to assess the co-occurrence of twenty-one mycotoxins and metabolites present in breakfast cereals primarily marketed for children in Portugal. Results showed that 96% of the analysed breakfast cereal samples were contaminated with several mycotoxins. Twenty-two combinations were identified including two to seven different mycotoxins. Conclusions pointed out an urgent need to review legislative limits in food matrices consumed by children and to perform a more accurate risk assessment of children's exposure to mycotoxins mixtures in food. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {We report an unusual aflatoxin profile in maize and groundnuts from Malawi, with aflatoxin G1 found routinely at equal or even higher levels than aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ratio in a contaminated sample is generally greater than 50 % of total aflatoxin (sum of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2). In Malawi, the aflatoxin occurrence ratios were determined by examining LC-MS/MS and HPLC fluorescence detection (FLD) data of 156 naturally contaminated raw maize and 80 groundnut samples collected in 2011 and 2012. Results showed that natural aflatoxin occurrence ratio differed. In 47 % of the samples, the concentration of AFG1 was higher than that of AFB1. The mean concentration percentages of AFB1/AFB2/AFG1/AFG2 in reference to total aflatoxins were found to be 47:5:43:5 %, respectively. The AFG1 and AFB1 50/50 trend was observed in maize and groundnuts and was consistent for samples collected in both years. If the AFB1 measurement was used to check compliance of total aflatoxin regulatory limit set at 10, 20, 100, and 200 μg/kg with an assumption that AFB1 ≥ 50 % of the total aflatoxin content, 8, 13, 24, and 26 % false negative rates would have occurred respectively. It is therefore important for legislation to consider total aflatoxins rather than AFB1 alone. © 2014, Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The occurrence of DON in hundred samples of wheat, maize and barley collected from different districts of Uttar Pradesh, India was examined. DON was detected in 30% samples out of which 7% samples exceeded the FSSR (Food Safety and Standard Regulation, India) limit (1 mg/kg). The contamination levels ranged from 0.01 mg/kg to 4.73 mg/kg. Of all the hundred cereal samples analyzed by HPLC, 19 positive samples (within the LOQ of 0.043 mg/kg) were further quantified by HPTLC, which showed comparable results suggesting that HPTLC is an equally reliable and cost effective method. Validation of DON in samples was performed by LC-MS analysis. Based on results of monitoring and the average actual consumption of wheat in India, the 90th percentile value of estimated daily intake (EDI) of DON was found to be 7.72 μg DON/kg body weight which exceeded the Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTDI 1 μg DON/kg-bw) proposed by JECFA by 7.7 folds there by suggesting the possibility of DON exposure to humans. Since DON levels have been set for wheat only there is a need to formulate regulatory standards for other cereals so as to reduce the exposure risk to DON. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, the effect of fermentation by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a mixture of yeast and a lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus plantarum LA7) in reducing aflatoxins in prepared sangak breads were compared. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was employed to determine toxin levels in the samples. With contamination levels ranging from 6.68 to 34.47 ng/g, the majority of the tested samples were not considered safe. Mean aflatoxin contamination of examined samples was 18.06 ng/g. Considering the limits for TAF in wheat flour set by ISIRI and EC (15 ng/g), 56.7% of the samples were unacceptable. No significant correlation was found between ash content and TAF levels (P>0.05). A significant decrease in aflatoxin levels was seen during sangak bread manufacturing (P<0.01). Dough fermentation by yeast and the mixture of yeast and L. plantarum LA7 resulted in 33.7 and 40.7% decrease in aflatoxin levels of the contaminated dough, respectively. On average, the sangak bread made with the most contaminated flours contained 11.1 ng/g of TAF, which was above the established maximum residual level in Iran and European countries.},

   abstract = {The importance or otherwise of rice as an exposure pathway for As ingestion by people living in Bengal and other areas impacted by hazardous As-bearing groundwaters is currently a matter of some debate. Here this issue is addressed by determining the overall increased cancer risk due to ingestion of rice in an As-impacted district of West Bengal. Human target cancer health risks have been estimated through the intake of As-bearing rice by using combined field, laboratory and computational methods. Monte Carlo simulations were run following fitting of model probability curves to measured distributions of (i) As concentration in rice and drinking water and (ii) inorganic As content of rice and fitting distributions to published data on (i) ingestion rates and (ii) body weight and point estimates on bioconcentration factors, exposure duration and other input variables. The distribution of As in drinking water was found to be substantially lower than that reported by previous authors for As in tube wells in the same area. indicating that the use of tube well water as a proxy for drinking water is likely to result in human health risks being somewhat overestimated. The calculated median increased lifetime cancer risk due to cooked rice intake was 7.62 x 10(-4), higher than the 10(-4)-10(-6) range typically used by the USEPA as a threshold to guide determination of regulatory values and similar to the equivalent risk from water intake. The median total risk from combined rice and water intake was 1.48 x 10(-3). The contributions to this median risk from drinking water, rice and cooking of rice were found to be 48%, 44% and 8%, respectively. Thus, rice is a major potential source of As exposure in the As-affected study areas in West Bengal and the most important exposure pathway for groups exposed to low or no As in drinking water.

   abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), 3-acetyl-DON (3-AcDON), 15-acetyl-DON (15-AcDON) and fusarenone X (Fus-X) were analysed in 148 breakfast cereal samples collected from the Spanish retail market. The samples were taken from the products most commonly consumed by the Spanish population. Major ingredients included corn, wheat and rice, alone or mixed. The trichothecenes were extracted with acetonitrile:water (84:16, v/v). The extracts were cleaned by means of Mycosep 227 columns. For analysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatisation to trimethylsilyl ethers was utilised. Mean recovery values, obtained from different matrices of cereal samples spiked with trichothecenes ranged from 69% to 110% with relative standard deviation lower than 10%. The estimated limits of detection and quantification, calculated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 and of 6:1, respectively, were between 8.90 and 14.7. μg/kg, and between 15.2 and 23.6. μg/kg, respectively. DON was the most frequently detected mycotoxin and was usually present at the highest concentration. NIV and Fus-X were detected in 4 and 2 samples, respectively; 3- and 15-AcDON were not detected. The calculated dietary intake was compared to tolerable daily intake (TDI) values. The survey demonstrated a regular occurrence of low levels of trichothecenes in breakfast cereals on the Spanish market. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The required databases including (PubMed and Scopus databases) were investigated to collect data on the concentration and prevalence of mentioned mycotoxins in cereal-based products. Among 2461 explored articles in identification step, 38 articles with 9627 samples were included in the conducted meta-analysis. The prevalence and concentration of studied mycotoxins varied with the cereal-based food studied. In this context, the overall rank order of mycotoxins prevalence in the cereal foods was OTA > DON > ZEN > TAF > 15-ADON > 3-ADON. Also, the overall rank order of mycotoxins based on concentration in the cereal foods investigated was DON > ZEN > 15-ADON > OTA > 3-ADON > TAF. The findings of this meta-analysis may be useful for the building of risk assessment models aiming to derive data for the development of specific actions to reduce the exposure to OTA, ZEN, TAF, and DON through the consumption of the cereal-based products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For that pu rpose, 48 samples of super kernel basmati rice types (white, brown, parboiled and broken) were collected from local markets of Lahore, Narowal, Faisalabad and Multan. Moisture contents and aflatoxin levels of the collected samples were determined. Aflatoxins detection in rice samples were done by HPLC technique. The results showed the presence of aflatoxins in rice samples. For the total (48) rice samples, 58% were contaminated with total aflatoxins out of which 56% were contaminated with aflatoxin B1 and 33% with aflatoxin B2. Out of 58% of the contaminated rice samples with total aflatoxins, 7% samples had aflatoxin level lower than the maximum tolerable limit of 4µg/kg and 93% samples were contaminated with total aflatoxin above the maximum tolerable limit. The 56% contaminated samples with aflatoxin B1, showed 100% contamination above the maximum tolerable limit (4µg/kg). A positive relationship was also seen between the moisture content and presence of aflatoxins (B1 and B2). The study showed significant (P&lt;0.05) results and it could add to various approaches leading to aflatoxin management in rice types. © 2016, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

Fungal contamination was determined by isolation on agar media, while mycotoxin analysis was by direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The wheat grain samples were highly contaminated with fungi, especially Epicoccum, Alternaria and Fusarium species. The mean Fusarium infection rate varied from 13% to 18%, with the major head blight-causing species being Fusarium poae, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium avenaceum. F. graminearum isolates were found to be highly virulent (79% disease severity) and significantly reduced kernel weight. Most grain samples were contaminated with mycotoxins, with a mean incidence rate of up to 75% for deoxynivalenol (DON) and 86% for T-2 toxin. Other mycotoxins detected were zearalenone and aflatoxin B1. Co-occurrence of DON, T-2 toxin and zearalenone was found in up to 35% of the samples. The results suggested the presence of Fusarium head blight and associated mycotoxins in Kenya. The presence of several mycotoxins, even at such low levels, could pose chronic adverse health effects to human and livestock fed on the contaminated wheat products. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {We conducted a survey of aflatoxin and fumonisin in maize in western Kenya. In a regional survey of aflatoxin conducted in 2009 across three agroecological zones within three administrative regions, milled maize samples were collected from 985 patrons of 26 hammer mills. Aflatoxin contamination was detected in 49% of samples and was above the regulatory (10 ppb) in 15% of the samples overall; 65% of samples from a drought-prone area were over the limit. In a detailed survey in Bungoma County, we investigated aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in four popular maize varieties at harvest and after 2 and 4 months of storage. We collected whole-grain samples from farmers' storage sheds and milled samples from patrons of local mills. Mean aflatoxin contamination was identical for storage sheds and mills at 2.3 ppb. In all, 41% of the samples from mills had detectable aflatoxin, with 4% over the regulatory limit, whereas 87% had detectable fumonisin, with 50% over the regulatory limit (1 ppm). Mean contamination levels did not change during storage. Maize varieties differed in fumonisin contamination, with the most popular varieties vulnerable to both mycotoxins and weevils, which are potential factors in exacerbating mycotoxin contamination. Mycotoxin surveillance is important not just in areas known previously for aflatoxin contamination and acute poisoning but also is needed in all maize-producing regions. © 2015 The American Phytopathological Society.},

   abstract = {In Kenya, maize remains an important staple food in every household. Unfortunately, the fungus Aspergillus flavus can infect the maize and produce aflatoxins. While government efforts to remove contaminated maize from circulation are well intentioned, there remain concerns that consumers are still being inadvertently exposed to aflatoxin. The aim of this study was to sample maize in different parts of Kenya and determine if consumers were inadvertently being chronically exposed to aflatoxins. Seventy-five maize samples and 27 samples of maize flour from three regions of Kenya (Nairobi, Eastern and Western) were analysed using an ELISA assay followed by microtiter plate reader (Neogen model) where the optical density of each microwell was read using a 450nm filter. There was a significant difference in aflatoxin levels in maize grains between the three regions and five stores (P < 0.05). Samples from Eastern Kenya had the highest contamination at 22.54±4.94 ppb, while those from Nairobi had the lowest (7.92±1.57 ppb). There was no significant difference in the total aflatoxin in maize flours from Nairobi, Western and Eastern regions (P > 0.05) at 95% confidence interval. Aflatoxin in maize flours were slightly above international upper limit of 5ppb but all the results were lower than the Kenya standard whose upper limit is 10ppb, indicating good manufacturing practices (GMP) by the millers. Samples of maize flours from Eastern Kenya had the highest aflatoxins concentrations at 6.98± 0.53 ppb. In summary, the study found aflatoxin contamination in maize grains especially in Eastern Kenya. The study concluded that measures put in place by government agencies for millers appear to be working. However, samples of maize grains showed variation among the regions and between stores, perhaps due to storage practices, with some levels far exceeding health limits. Due to higher levels of aflatoxin contamination in maize grains in relation to maize flours, the government and relevant stakeholders need to establish further measures to protect consumers.},

Tropical climate and inappropriate food safety practices in Indonesia are the favorable conditions for AfB1 contamination of foodstuffs. Despite these challenges, there has been a limited number of risk assessment of AfB1 conducted in Indonesia. Therefore, this paper aimed to gather all available occurrence data of AfB1 in maize and peanut originating from Indonesia and used the occurrence data to evaluate the risk of exposure to AfB1 using the Margin of Exposure (MOE) and the quantitative liver cancer risk approaches established by EFSA and FAO/WHO respectively. Risk assessment using both the MOE and quantitative liver cancer risk approaches revealed that AfB1 exposure from maize and peanut consumption in Indonesia is of concern. The MOE values derived from consumption of maize and peanut originating from Indonesia were generally below 10,000, and for several occurrence data were even below 1000. The estimated number of liver cancer cases associated with AfB1 exposure generally was above the 0.1 cancer cases/100,000 individuals/75 years. Altogether the evaluation reveals the urgency for risk management of AfB1 in Indonesia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {A survey was conducted in 2013 to establish total aflatoxin and total fumonisin in maize, as well as farmers' practices relating to maize cultivation and awareness of mycotoxins, in three villages of Babati District, northern Tanzania. Quantification of total aflatoxin and fumonisin was done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Reveal AccuScan® Neogen, USA) and the results were confirmed using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer. The mean aflatoxin was 2.94 μg/kg and all samples (n=440) were within the East African Community (EAC) standard of 10 μg/kg for total aflatoxin, but the mean fumonisin was 5.15 mg/kg, more than double the EAC standard of 2 mg/kg, and 35% of samples exceeded this standard. Maize samples obtained from farmers in the village in the mid altitude, dry zone had significantly higher mean aflatoxin (3.32 μg/kg) and significantly lower mean fumonisin (3.17 mg/kg) than maize from the other two villages (in the high and mid altitude, high rainfall zones). Most farmers (n=442) were male (72%), educated to primary school level (77%) and aware of mycotoxins (62%). As well as participating in a development program, Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation, most (86%) farmers had experience of working with other development programs. All farmers used flat planting, most used improved seeds (98%), ox ploughing (78%), insecticides (78%) and early planting (36%). Practices associated with mycotoxins were planting time, tillage methods, previous season planted crops, and use of insecticides. Awareness of mycotoxins and climatic conditions were also associated with mycotoxin prevalence. In conclusion, good practices are associated with acceptable aflatoxin levels and should be continued. However, the high level of fumonisins warrants further investigation.},

A total of 160 samples were collected in 2013-14. Quantification for total aflatoxin and fumonisin was done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Reveal AccuScan® Neogen, USA) and the results were confirmed using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer. Aflatoxin was detected in 32% of maize samples (mean 3.4 ± 0.3 μg/kg; range 2.1-16.2 μg/kg) and fumonisin in 39% of samples (mean 5.6 ± 1.40 mg/kg; range 0.4-62.0 mg/kg). Among marketed products, maize bran (used for animal feed) was the most contaminated (2.4 μg/kg aflatoxin and 1 mg/kg fumonisin), followed by whole maize in market stalls (1.9 μg/kg aflatoxin and 0.4 mg/kg fumonisin) and then maize flour (1.4 μg/kg aflatoxin and 0.3 mg/kg fumonisin). Un-marketed maize sorted out by farmers as "bad" and intended for animal feeding was the most contaminated (overall mean aflatoxin and fumonisin levels of 1.7 μg/kg and 7.4 mg/kg, respectively). The results indicate that levels of aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in marketed maize were within tolerable limits.},

The levels of pesticide residues in food are often determined as a means of assessing appropriate use as well as the potential for human exposure to these chemicals and hence their potential damage to human health. The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in maize samples collected from various markets in Lagos State and compare these values with established safety values. Maize (Zea mays L.) samples purchased from different markets in LagosState were analyzed for residues of organophosphateand carbamate pesticides. Analysis was done using gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS) after careful extraction and cleanup. It was found that all the maize samples contained residues of one or more organophosphate or carbamate pesticides. Mean concentrations ranged from 12.0 to 1565.4 μg/kg. Maximum residue limits (MRL) of some of the pesticides were exceeded in up to 10% of samples.},

Fungal and bacterial populations in rice samples were significantly different between regions in 2007. Aflatoxins were also detected and varied at the levels of 2.45-3.43 ng per g unhulled rice grain and 1.29-2.09 ng per g white rice grain. Unhulled rice generally detected higher level of aflatoxins than white rice regardless of sampling regions; however, no significant differences were found in Anseong and Cheonan in 2005 and Cheonan and Gimpo in 2007. Aflatoxin production between sampling regions was not different regardless of rice type and sampling year. Although the fungal diversity was highly distinct from region to region, three Aspergillus isolates were predominant in the rice samples; thus, representative isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were selected and identified based on their morphological and molecular characteristics. Consequently, isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were identified as A. candidus, A flavus, and A. fumigatus, respectively. These fungi can produce mycotoxins that are harmful for consumers and thus it is important to detect and reduce the population of storage fungi in rice. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.},

DON contamination in agricultural food staples such as wheat, barley, and maize due to Fusarium colonization is an increasing problem. In order to provide risk managers with better guidance for regulatory measures, the concentration of DON in cereal-based foods (n = 689), collected from six cities between June 2005 and August 2008, was determined. Further, dietary exposure to DON was estimated by combining data on DON concentration in these foods with their consumption rates. Among 689 samples, 272 samples (39%) were contaminated with DON. Relatively high DON concentrations were found in dried corn, with a mean concentration of 109 mu g/kg ( n = 74). Daily intake of DON simulated by the @Risk program was estimated to between 0.066 and 0.142 mu g/kg body weight (bw)/d for males and between 0.066 and 0.144 mu g/kg bw/d for females. The major contributor to DON exposure in the 50th and 95th percentile intake groups was polished rice. For each age class, young children (3-6 yr) showed the highest relative intake, with a mean intake of 0.142 mg/kg bw/d for males and 0.144 mu g/kg bw/d for females. However, the estimated daily DON intake did not exceed the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (1 mu g/kg bw/d) for any age group or gender. From our risk assessment, it was concluded that the current intake of DON in South Korea may not serve as a serious health hazard.},

A ultra high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) method was developed and validated to screen for the presence of these mycotoxins in those cereal matrices. Matrix-matched calibration curves were used to compensate for ion suppression and extraction losses and the recovery values were in agreement with the minimum requirements of Regulation 401/2006/EC (70-110%). For most mycotoxins, the LODs obtained allowed detection in compliance with the maximum permitted levels set in Regulation EC/2006/1881, with the exception of OTA in all cereals and AFB1 in yellow noodles. Extra target analysis of OTA in oat flakes and wheat noodles was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. High rates of contamination were observed in paddy rice (23% DON, 23% FB1, 7% AFB1, 2% AFG1 and 2% AFG2), white wheat noodles (33% DON and 5% OTA) and oat flakes (17% DON, 2% OTA and 2% AFB1), whereas the rates of contamination were lower in polished rice (2% AFG1 and 4% HT-2 toxin) and yellow noodles (5% DON). Low rates of co-occurrence of several mycotoxins were observed only for white wheat noodles (5%) and paddy rice (7%). White noodles were contaminated with DON and/or OTA, while combinations of AFG1, AFB1, DON and FB1 were found in paddy rice. Yellow noodles were contaminated with DON only; oat flakes contained DON, OTA or AFB1, and polished rice was contaminated with AFG1 and HT-2 toxin. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

   abstract = {During the baking heat exchange process, various chemical transformations take place and form new chemical compounds, and the final result is bread. Furans are some of these volatile aromatic compounds. They are formed in the heat exchange processes of food production- baking, heating, and roasting. One of these compounds is 5-hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde (HMF), which is widely distributed in food products such as bread, coffee, honey, milk products, meat, fish, beer and others. Aromatic volatile compounds endow rye bread with its characteristic aroma and taste. The formation of furan and its derivatives in food products is not clearly understood. In 2004, the Europe Food Safety Authority started to collect data from EU member states of HMF content in food products. There is no such information available on Latvian foodstuffs. Specifically, in Latvia, there have been no investigations on HMF formation in rye bread during bake processing to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic of HMF formation in whole meal rye bread crumb and crust, as influenced by baking time. The bread was produced in a Latvian commercial bakery. The content of HMF in whole meal rye bread was determined by using liquid chromatography. The study showed that Latvian whole meal rye bread baked at the optimal time of 60 minutes contains 320.6 mg kg-1 HMF. Its content in rye bread crumb reached 22 mg kg-1, which is substantially different from the HMF content of bread crust. During the prolonged baking time, the rate of HMF formation is no significant.},

   abstract = {This study assessed the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) intake of the Thai population through consumption of contaminated brown and color rice. A total of 240 rice samples from two harvesting periods were collected in June/July 2012 (period I) and in December 2012/January 2013 (period II) and analyzed for AFB1 by HPLC with fluorescence detection (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.093 ng/g). Exposure assessment was based on AFB1 levels in rice and food intake data for rice according to Thai National Consumption. Frequency and levels of AFB1 were higher in period I (59 %, &lt;LOD = 26.61 μg kg−1) than in period II (10 %, &lt;LOD = 3.51 μg kg−1). Only one sample exceeded the Thai standard limit for total aflatoxin of 20 μg kg−1, but 12 out of 240 rice samples exceeded the European Union maximum level for AFB1 of 2 μg kg−1. The data showed that the quality and safety of Thai rice largely comply with the requirement for both exports and domestic consumption. According to the Thai National Consumption data, the estimated AFB1 intake via rice consumption in period I and period II was 0.80 and 0.12 μg kg−1 bw day−1, respectively. The potential risk for cancer, based on the recommendation of the JECFA, was estimated to be 0.011 person/year/100,000 people at a mean consumption. Although the risk via consumption of Thai rice seems to be low, the maximum levels of AFB1 in this staple food suggest that careful monitoring and surveillance of AFB1 contamination in rice is essential to ensure the safety of rice. © 2015, Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Either naturally contaminated samples or samples artificially inoculated with Fusarium sporotrichioides under field conditions were used. A method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with immunoaffinity column cleanup was validated in-house for the simultaneous analysis of both toxins in a variety of matrices, including uncleaned wheat, cleaned wheat, screenings, bran, red dog, fine middlings, and semolina. Mean recoveries from samples spiked with T-2 and HT-2 toxins at levels of 100 μg/kg ranged from 85 to 107%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 14%. The milling process led to an increase of T-2 and HT-2 toxin contents up to 13-and 5-fold in screenings and bran, respectively, compared with occurrence in the uncleaned wheat; however, an overall reduction of T-2 and HT-2 toxins by 54% (RSD, 20%) and 89% (RSD, 3%) was observed in cleaned wheat and in semolina, respectively.

   abstract = {In Slovenia, a mass poisoning incident involving 73 consumers with symptoms such as dry mouth, hot red skin, blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, ataxia, speech disturbance, disorientation and visual hallucinations occurred in 2003. In all cases, consumers had eaten buckwheat flour food products within the last few hours. Investigations by responsible authorities identified the contamination of a range of buckwheat food products with thorn-apple (Datura stramonium L.) seeds containing toxic alkaloids, atropine and scopolamine. To ensure the safe consumption of buckwheat food products, we carried out risk characterisation and proposed provisional maximum residue levels (MRLs) of atropine and scopolamine mixture in buckwheat flour. In the absence of critical no observed adverse effect levels for atropine and scopolamine, we based our estimation of the acute reference doses on the lowest recommended therapeutic doses. Taking into account the additive effect of the two alkaloids, we calculated acute reference doses of the mixture, that is 0.05?mu g/kg of body mass for atropine and 0.03?mu g/kg of body mass for scopolamine. MRLs for atropine and scopolamine mixture in buckwheat flour were estimated in a worst-case scenario, that is consumption of 100?g of flour by a child weighing 10?kg and taking into account a range of atropine/scopolamine ratio in implicated food products, that is 0.853.3. We proposed the national MRLs for atropine/scopolamine mixture in buckwheat food products: 4.0?mu g/kg (atropine) and 2.0?mu g/kg(scopolamine). However, in view of the large variability in the alkaloid content, depending on the origin of the Datura, we propose that risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the ratio between atropine and scopolamine content in a particular sample.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are highly toxic carcinogens that contaminate crops worldwide. Previous studies conducted in Nigeria and Ghana found high concentrations of aflatoxins in pre- and post-harvest maize. However, little information is available on the population structure of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi in West Africa. We determined the incidence of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi and the level of aflatoxin contamination in 91 maize samples from farms and markets in Nigeria and Ghana. Aspergillus spp. were recovered from 61/91 maize samples and aflatoxins B1 and/or B2 occurred in 36/91 samples. Three samples from the farms also contained aflatoxin G1 and/or G2. Farm samples were more highly contaminated than were samples from the market, in terms of both the percentage of the samples contaminated and the level of mycotoxin contamination. One-hundred-and-thirty-five strains representative of the 1163 strains collected were identified by using a multilocus sequence analysis of portions of the genes encoding calmodulin, β-tubulin and actin, and evaluated for aflatoxin production. Of the 135 strains, there were 110 - Aspergillus flavus, 20 - Aspergillus tamarii, 2 - Aspergillus wentii, 2 - Aspergillus flavofurcatus, and 1 - Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus. Twenty-five of the A.flavus strains and the A.parvisclerotigenus strain were the only strains that produced aflatoxins. The higher contamination of the farm than the market samples suggests that the aflatoxin exposure of rural farmers is even higher than previously estimated based on reported contamination of market samples. The relative infrequency of the A.flavus SBG strains, producing small sclerotia and high levels of both aflatoxins (B and G), suggests that long-term chronic exposure to this mycotoxin are a much higher health risk in West Africa than is the acute toxicity due to very highly contaminated maize in east Africa. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This study focused on the radioecology of rice and explored how the French specificities of rice cultivation can be taken into account in risk assessment. The objective of the study was to characterize the radioecological sensitivity of rice with respect to an accidental release of radioactivity. We want to know if a uniform and specific deposit would involve the same contamination on representative paddy fields of Camargue. To model the transfer of the radionuclides in the rice caryopsis following an accidental atmospheric pollution, we used the classical modelling for the cereals which considers first the interception by the foliage (modelled by an interception ratio) then the translocation to the grain (modelled by a translocation factor). The values of the parameters (interception ratio, translocation factor and yield) were regionalized with the agronomical software ORIZA2000, developed by the IRRI (International Rice Research Institute). We partly calibrated ORIZA2000 for a French rice variety: Ariete, thanks to physiological data provided for International Cooperation Centre in Agronomical Research for Development (CIRAD). ORIZA2000 proposes a daily follow-up of the leaf area index which can be correlated with the interception ratio. Five simulations with various climates, irrigation managements, and technical uses have been inputted on ORIZA2000. The data inputted were extracted from the database AGROSYST from the French Institute for Agronomical Research (INRA) and from the CIRAD. We established two scenarios of contamination. The first one consisted in a single contamination of water. In this case, there is almost no difference between simulations. However, in each simulation (except for organic farming) it is relevant to notice that the fourth depletion of water leads to a significant variation of contamination. The second contamination scenario consisted in a double contamination of water and of air. In that case, technical practices are responsible of the highest source of variability of the grain contamination. The variability of the contamination is mainly due to the variability of the yield which has in the radioecological modelling a dilution effect. The rice produced by organic farming is more sensitive than the rice produced by conventional farming because of low yields. © 2009 EDP Sciences.},

Groundwater (n = 11), rice (n = 11) and fingernail (n = 23) samples were randomly collected from the households and analyzed for total As by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Calculation indicated that daily dose of inorganic As was greater than the lower limits on the benchmark dose for a 0.5% increased incidence of lung cancer (BMDL0.5 equals to 3.0 mu g d(-1) kg(body wt.)(-1)). Moreover, positive correlation between As in fingernail and daily dose of As from groundwater and rice and total daily dose of As were found. These results suggest that the Prey Veng residents are exposed to As in groundwater. As in rice is an additional source which is attributable to high As accumulation in human bodies in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   section = {Not Relevant},
   abstract = {Moulds of Aspergillus genus are among the most important causes of food and feed spoilage and can produce mycotoxins as toxic secondary metabolites when under adverse conditions. Aflatoxins are a group of mycotoxins that commonly contaminate maize and groundnuts, and are categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer under Class 1A human carcinogens. From the food safety standpoint, one of the most important mycotoxins is aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Due to its potent carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects dependent on the level and length of exposure, the presence of this contaminant in food and feed should be kept as low as achievable. In order to investigate the occurrence of AFB1, determine its concentrations and explore the possibility of its reduction using different methods, samples of maize, wheat, barley and oat were collected from different cultivation fields during a three-year period. The immunoassay (ELISA) as a screening method and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a confirmatory method were used to determine AFB1 concentrations. Maize contamination seen with AFB1 concentrations higher than permitted was associated with climate conditions established in the period of concern, which was extremely warm and dry, and might had favored mould production and AFB1 formation. Substantial to almost absolute AFB1 reduction in the maize samples was achieved using gamma radiation. A strong antifungal effect was also obtained upon the use of essential oils and lactic acid bacteria as biological AFB1-reduction alternatives. As the presence of AFB1 in cereals could be dangerous for human and animal health, in order to prevent its harmful effects and huge economic problems, the prevention of formation of this contaminant and consistent control over it are of major interest. Based on these substantiated grounds, possibilities of implementing new methods of AFB1 determination and reduction within the frame of safe food production are virtually countless. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of fumonisins and zearalenone in maize, stored in 10 family farms located in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Samples were collected in four periods, at intervals of two months, totalling 40 samples. Mycotoxins were isolated using commercial immunoaffinity columns and its concentrations were evaluated by fluorometric technique. Fumonisins were detected in all 40 samples, with values ranging from 230 to 6450 μg kg -1, and zearalenone was detected in 38 maize samples, with levels from 1.8 to 99 μg kg -1. Zearalenone levels were below the acceptable limit for human consumption but the fumonisins levels were above this limit in most samples, implying in risks to consumers' health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The recovery percentages of OTA from spiked rice samples at concentrations of 5 and 10 ng/g were found to be 85.3% and 86.7%, respectively. Analytical results showed a 9.4% frequency of contamination from total analyzed rice samples with a mean OTA level of 3.60 ± 2.66 ng/g. Concentrations of OTA in positive samples ranged from 0.84 ng/g to 11.37 ng/g, and in 17.3% of contaminated rice samples the concentrations exceeded the maximum tolerance limit set by European regulations for OTA in cereals (5 ng/g). Based on the results of this study, the estimated daily intake of OTA in rice was 0.62 ng/kg body weight/day for Iranian consumers. © SAGE Publications.},

   abstract = {Rice is the staple food for the people of arsenic endemic South (S) and South-East (SE) Asian countries. In this region, arsenic contaminated groundwater has been used not only for drinking and cooking purposes but also for rice cultivation during dry season. Irrigation of arsenic-contaminated groundwater for rice cultivation has resulted high deposition of arsenic in topsoil and uptake in rice grain posing a serious threat to the sustainable agriculture in this region. In addition, cooking rice with arsenic-contaminated water also increases arsenic burden in cooked rice. Inorganic arsenic is the main species of S and SE Asian rice (80 to 91% of the total arsenic), and the concentration of this toxic species is increased in cooked rice from inorganic arsenic-rich cooking water. The people of Bangladesh and West Bengal (India), the arsenic hot spots in the world, eat an average of 450. g rice a day. Therefore, in addition to drinking water, dietary intake of arsenic from rice is supposed to be another potential source of exposure, and to be a new disaster for the population of S and SE Asian countries. Arsenic speciation in raw and cooked rice, its bioavailability and the possible health hazard of inorganic arsenic in rice for the population of S and SE Asia have been discussed in this review. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Rice is an important route of arsenic (As) exposure to humans, especially populations with rice-based diets. Human health risk of As varies greatly with rice variety and country of origin. The purpose of the present study was to determine total and speciated As in Australian-grown and imported rice on sale in Australia to assess their health risk to consumers. The total As (tAs) concentrations in Australian-grown organic brown, medium grain brown, and organic white rice were 438 +/- 23, 287 +/- 03, and 283 +/- 18 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d wt), respectively. In Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, and Thai rice imported and on sale in Australia, tAs concentrations were 56 +/- 05, 92 +/- 10, 82 +/- 06 and 172 +/- 24 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Asian rice contained mainly inorganic As (iAs; 86-99%), whereas 18-26% of the tAs in Australian-grown rice was dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Relatively higher concentrations of tAs in Australian-grown rice than that in imported rice of Asian origin suggest that Australian-grown rice may be a health risk for the consumers. It was estimated that Australian-grown organic brown rice can contribute up to 98% of the FAO/WHO recommended maximum tolerable daily intake limit of iAs (2.1 mu g kg(-1) body wt day(-1)) for Asian immigrants. However, other Australian consumers including European immigrants are unlikely to be at risk to As from rice diets due to their lower rice consumption rates than that of Asian immigrants. The risk assessment showed that imported rice on sale in Australia was likely to pose a lower health risk to consumers than Australian-grown rice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important coarse cereal crop grown for grain and fodder in the semi-arid Tropics, mainly in Asian and African countries. In India sorghum is consumed as human food and poultry feed. Sorghum grain grown in the rainy season (kharif) is becoming severely affected by grain moulds, the major fungi involved being Aspergillus, Fusarium and Curvularia. If the extent of mould is severe, the grain is unsafe for consumption owing to contamination by mycotoxins. RESULTS: This paper presents a multi-centre study conducted in sorghum to evaluate natural contamination of aflatoxin B1 in India. A total of 1606 grain sorghum samples were collected during the rainy (kharif) season across 4 years from seven states of India, representing different geographical regions of the country. Aflatoxin B1 contamination during 2007-08 was the highest (13.1%), followed by samples from the year 2004-05 (2.85%). The samples collected in years 2005-06 and 2006-07 showed contamination below 1%. The number of samples (35) showing aflatoxin B1 contamination above the safety limit was also highest during 2007-08 as compared to samples from the other years. CONCLUSION: This study, conducted for 4 years, showed that natural contamination of aflatoxin B1 in sorghum grown in India is within safety limits (20 μg kg-1) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Committee and 73% of samples were positive for toxin. However, 0.75% (12) of total samples contained aflatoxin above the safety limit. The overall occurrence of toxin from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan was below 5 μg kg-1. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {In the United States, packaged food ingredients derived from allergenic sources must be clearly labeled. However, no requirement exists to declare the presence of residues of raw agricultural commodities due to agricultural commodity comingling. Clinical reports of allergic reactions to undeclared soy in wheat-based products do not exist suggesting that a rather low degree of risk is posed by wheat-based products that are comingled with soy. Detectable soybean residues (>2.5. ppm soy flour) were found in 62.8% of commercially available wheat flours at concentrations of 3-443. ppm soy flour (1.6-236. ppm soy protein). Conservative probabilistic risk assessments predict a risk of allergic reaction among the most sensitive soy-allergic individuals of 2.8 ± 2.0 per 1000 soy-allergic user eating occasions of foods containing wheat flour. However, the predicted reactions occur at exposure levels below the lowest eliciting dose observed to provoke objective reactions in clinical oral soy challenges. Given this low level of predicted risk and the lack of evidence for allergic reactions among soy-allergic consumers to wheat-based products, the avoidance of wheat-based products by soy-allergic consumers does not appear to be necessary. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Presence of harmful pesticide residue in food is a serious cause for concern among consumers so it is important to monitor levels of pesticides in foods. The aim of this study was simultaneous determination of concentrations of 58 pesticides in 40 wheat flour samples collected from Tehran market in January, 2014. The city under study (Tehran) was divided into five districts and samples were collected independently from each district and sourced from different bakeries (n=40). A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry single quadrupole selected ion monitoring «GC/MS-SQ-SIM» method was used to quantify residue of 58 pesticides in the wheat flour samples. Four of the 40 samples showed contamination with Malathion (2 samples: 50.96 ± 11.38 and 62.088 ± 11.38 ppb) and 2, 4-DDE (2 samples: 19.88±15.24 and 13.7 ± 15.24 ppb). that had levels below MRLs of these pesticides in Iran. Averages of recovery of pesticides at 6 concentration levels were in the range of 81.61-118.41%. The method was proven as repeatable with RSDr in the range of 6.5-29.45% for all concentration levels. The limit of quantification for 37 of the tested pesticides was calculated as 15 ppb and for the other 21 tested pesticides, the concentration was 25 ppb. In summary, results of these tests suggested that the wheat flour consumed in Tehran, was within safety limits in terms of levels of pesticide residues. © 2017 by School of Pharmacy Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.},

   abstract = {Background: A variety of agricultural products are exposed to fungal contamination from the early stages of planting, until their final consumption. T-2 mycotoxin is toxic to humans and to all animal species, it is mainly produced by the various Fusarium species including; F. sporotrichioides, F. poae, F equiseti, and F. acuminatum, and occasionally by other genera species, therefore, measuring T-2 toxin levels is very important in cereals. Objectives: We examined the occurrence and levels of T-2 mycotoxin in grains for human consumption. Materials and Methods: Rice, barley and wheat samples, 23, 16 and 7 respectively, were collected from the staple stores of nine food cooking centers in Tehran. After pulverizing the samples, they were extracted using a methanol-water solution (70:30), then analysed with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on the monoclonal antibodies, the amount of T-2 mycotoxin was measured in their extracts. Results: All of the tested samples were contaminated with T-2 toxin at different levels ranging from 7.9 to 65.9 μg/kg (mean: 17.9 ± 2.1). Wheat samples had the highest level of contamination at approximately 42.4 μg/kg (± 8.4). However, both barley and rice were also affected with contamination levels of 18.3 (±2) and 12.5 (± 0.56) μg/kg respectively. Conclusions: Although the majority of samples were based on Iranian national standards, a small number of specimens (13.9 %) were contaminated at higher than acceptable limits. The extent of the impurities with T-2 toxin is an indicator of the current normal prevalence of mycotoxins in agricultural products destined for human consumption in this country, and the risk of exposure to the chronic effects of this toxin. Overall, this study showed that the level of mycotoxins in food products should be checked before they are bought or consumed. © 2012 Kowsar Corp.},

   abstract = {Wheat is a basic staple food for very large segments of the population of Algeria. The aim of this study is to analyse ochratoxin A (OTA)-producing mould and OTA-contaminated wheat. To evaluate the mycoflora and the potential for OTA production by Aspergillus strains, a total of 85 samples of wheat destined for human consumption were collected from two regions in Algeria (Tizi Ouzou and Setif) during the following phases: preharvest, storage in silos, and after processing. The mean value counts of fungi ranged from 275 to 1277 CFU g- 1. The dominant genus was Aspergillus, predominantly A. flavus, A. niger and A. versicolor. The other isolated species were A. ochraceus, A. alliaceus, A. carbonarius, A. terreus, A. fumigatus, A. candidus and Aspergillus spp. The occurrence and the levels of the genus Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria and Mucor were substantially lower than those of Aspergillus. The storage in silos shows high levels of Aspergillus (66 to 84%), especially A. flavus, but A. niger and other fungi were isolated at relatively low percentages. Equal distribution of the fungal contamination into the bran, flour and semolina fractions was observed from Flour Mill and Semolina Mill. The genus Aspergillus remained present at high levels at several phases of the production process. In addition, the ability to produce OTA by 135 isolates belonging to eleven species of Aspergillus and 23 isolates of Penicillium spp. was analyzed using fluorescent detection-based HPLC. Thus, it was found that 51 isolates (32.3%) were ochratoxigenic. All isolated strains of A. ochraceus (12) and A. alliaceus (6) produced OTA at concentrations ranging from 0.23 to 11.50 μg g- 1. Most of the A. carbonarius strains (80%) were OTA producers (0.01 to 9.35 μg g- 1), whereas A. terreus (50%), A. niger (28%), A. fumigatus (40%), A. versicolor (18%) and Penicillium spp. (21.7%) were low level producers (0.01 to 0.07 μg g- 1). The concentration of OTA was determined in 30 samples of wheat. OTA was detected in 12 (40%) of the samples at levels ranging from 0.21 to 41.55 μg kg- 1. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Good analytical performance was obtained through extraction with acetonitrile:water (90:10), clean-up with immunoaffinity columns, and detection and quantification by liquid chromatograph with-tandem mass spectrometry. ZEA levels were determined in 52 samples to verify the compliance with the maximum permitted levels by the European legislation. One broa sample exceeded the maximum limit established. A higher contamination frequency was observed in samples in which maize and wheat were present. Overall, 13.5% of the samples were contaminated, at levels oscillating between 9.6 and 50.4μg/kg. Considering the percentage of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) obtained, 0.6%, the risk assessment linked with the exposure to ZEA was considered very low for the studied population. This is the first study on the intake assessment of ZEA through maize bread consumption in Portugal. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are harmful substances produced by fungi in several commodities with a widespread presence in foodstuffs. Human exposure to mycotoxins occurs mainly by contaminated food. The quantitation of mycotoxins in cereal-based food, highly consumed by different age population, is of concern. In this survey, 159 cereal-based samples classified as wheat, maize and rice-based, have been evaluated for the occurrence of patulin, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, nivalenol, neosolaniol, HT-2, T-2 and zearalenone by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Intakes were calculated for average consumers among adults, children and infants and compared with the tolerable daily intakes (TDI). Data obtained were used to estimate the potential exposure levels. 65.4% of the samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin and 15.7% of the analyzed samples showed co-occurrence of mycotoxin. The dietary exposure to HT-2 and T-2 toxins was estimated as 0.010 and 0.086 mu g kg(-1) bw d(-1), amounting to 10% and 86% of the TDI, for adults and infants respectively. These results back up the necessity to take a vigilant attitude in order to minimize human intake of mycotoxins. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a metalloid that may represent a serious environmental threat, due to its wide abundance and the high toxicity particularly of its inorganic forms. The use of arsenic-contaminated groundwater for irrigation purposes in crop fields elevates the arsenic concentration in topsoil and its phytoavailability for crops. The transfer of arsenic through the crops-soil-water system is one of the more important pathways of human exposure. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, maize (Zea mays L) is the most cultivated cereal in the world. This cereal constitutes a staple food for humans in the most of the developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Thus, this review summarizes the existing literature concerning the conditions involved in agricultural soil that leads to As influx into maize crops and the uptake mechanisms, metabolism and phytotoxicity of As in corn plants. Additionally, the studies of the As accumulation in raw corn grain and corn food are summarized, and the As biotransfer into the human diet is highlighted. Due to high As levels found in editable plant part for livestock and humans, the As uptake by corn crop through water-soil-maize system may represent an important pathway of As exposure in countries with high maize consumption.

   abstract = {One hundred and fifty-six samples of breakfast cereals were collected from the Canadian retail marketplace over a 3-year period. The samples were analysed for the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, HT-2 toxin, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, and fumonisins B1 and B2 to contribute to dietary exposure estimates in support of the development of Canadian guidelines for selected mycotoxins in foods. The samples included corn-, oat-, wheat- and rice-based cereals, as well as mixed-grain cereals, and were primarily from North American processors. Overall, deoxynivalenol was the most frequently detected mycotoxin - it was detected in over 40% of all samples analysed. Fumonisins and ochratoxin A were each detected in over 30% of all samples. Zearalenone was detected in over 20% of all samples. Nivalenol and HT-2 toxin were each detected in only one sample. The survey clearly demonstrated regular occurrence of low levels of multiple mycotoxins in breakfast cereals on the Canadian market.},

The tadpoles at stages 49 and 50 were exposed to the herbicides at several concentrations during 96 h, and median lethal concentration (LC50) values were calculated at 24-h intervals. The LC50 values of simetryn, mefenacet, and thiobencarb were 16.9-3.70 mg/L (79.3-17.4 γM), 3.06-2.70 mg/L (10.3-9.04 γM), and 1.77-0.752 mg/L (6.85-2.92 γM), respectively. The most toxic herbicide was thiobencarb followed by mefenacet and simetryn. As for thiobencarb, the sensitivity of S. tropicalis was similar to that of X. laevis reported previously. This suggests that S. tropicalis as well as X. laevis can act as a model species in acute toxicity tests. The LC50 values of the three herbicides were very close to or at most two orders of magnitude higher than the maximum concentrations likely to occur in paddy water. Therefore, the three herbicides can be harmful to amphibian larvae living in paddy water. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Approximately 13% of the Fusarium isolates recovered from finger millet growing at three different locations in eastern Uganda belong to Fusarium verticillioides, and could produce up to 18,600 μg/g of total fumonisins when cultured under laboratory conditions. These strains are all genetically unique, based on AFLP analyses, and form fertile perithecia when crossed with the standard mating type tester strains for this species. All but one of the strains is female-fertile and mating-type segregates 13:20 Mat-1:Mat-2. Three new sequences of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1- α were found within the population. These results indicate a potential health risk for infants who consume finger millet gruel as a weaning food, and are consistent with the hypothesis that F. verticillioides originated in Africa and not in the Americas, despite its widespread association with maize grown almost anywhere worldwide. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

For this purpose, a total of 128 corn and barley samples were collected from 16 different large industrial dairy farms. Mean moisture of the samples collected in different seasons of the year was significantly different (P < 0.05). The most prevalent fungi isolated from corn samples were Penicillium spp. (90.62%) and Aspergillus spp. (82.81%), and that of barley samples was Penicillium spp. (89.06%). Frequency of Fusarium spp. in corn and barley samples was 85.93% and 26.56%, respectively. All isolates (100%) were confirmed as Fusarium using an ITS primer. Eight (11.11%) out of 72 Fusarium spp. isolates were confirmed as F. graminearum using species-specific primers. Five out of 8 F. graminearum isolates were positive in terms of the presence of the trichothecene-producing gene using a Tri5-specific primer. Three and 2 out of 5 toxin-producing F. graminearum isolates were positive using Tri13DON- and Tri13NIV-specific primers, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of toxigenic Fusarium in corn and barley samples used in feedstuffs in Iran is a potential risk to animal and human health. © TüBITAK.},

   abstract = {The exposure to inorganic arsenic in Sweden occurs mainly via certain foods. This assessment shows that rice is the greatest source of exposure to inorganic arsenic (27–31 percent) for the population of Sweden. The median exposure from foods, including rice, is estimated to be approximately 0.07 for adults, 0.10 for 11/12-year-olds, 0.13 for 8/9 year-olds and 0.18 μg/kg b.w./day for 4 year-olds. The Swedish National Food Agency’s so-called “Risk Thermometer” has been used to evaluate the risks. The Risk Thermometer has five different risk classes and the estimated exposure to arsenic in food classify, generally speaking, in risk class 3. For children, and especially young children, the exposure is close to or above the limit of what is generally acceptable from a health perspective. The acceptable arsenic exposure is regarded to be approximately 0.15 μg per kilo body weight per day, of which 0.045 μg per kilo body weight per day, or 30 percent, comes from rice. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

   abstract = {Tolerable limits set for deoxynivalenol (DON) do not consider DON conjugates such as DON-3-glucoside. Conjugates may be metabolized in vivo to DON. Such masked mycotoxins and the potentially toxic Fusarium pigment are not routinely analyzed in cereals. We quantified DON, DON-3-glucoside, and a red Fusarium pigment in hard red spring wheat, using a new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Extraction protocols using centrifugation and shaking, and methanol-methylene chloride (50:50 [vol/vol]) or acetonitrile-water (84:16 [vol/vol]) were assessed. Purposively and randomly selected hard spring wheat samples were extracted with solvent filtered through a C18 column and analyzed using liquid chromatography-UV-mass spectrometry. Isocratic mobile phase (70% methanol) was used. Recoveries were 96.4% (DON) and 70.0% (DON-3-glucoside), while limits of detection were 1 mu g/kg (MS) and 10 mu g/kg (UV), and limits of quantification were 1 mu g/kg (UV) and 0.5 mu g/kg (MS), respectively. The pigment limits of quantification and limits of detection on the MS were 4.3 and 0.0005 mu g/kg, respectively. The purposively selected samples had DON, DON-3-glucoside, and pigment averages of 3.4 +/- 4.0 mu g/g, 3.8 +/- 8.3 mu g/g, and 0.31 +/- 3.71 g/kg, respectively. The randomly selected spring wheat had lower mean levels of DON (1.4 +/- 2.3 mu g/g), DON-3-glucoside (0.2 +/- 1.0 mu g/g), and pigment (147.93 +/- 247.84 mu g/g). Analytical tools such as this new liquid chromatography-UV-mass spectrometry method can be used to quantify masked and parent mycotoxins, plus a potentially toxic pigment for risk assessment.},

   abstract = {Fusarium head blight of wheat is caused by the Fusarium species that produces mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON). The distribution of DON in wheat products can lead to high economic and health impacts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the natural distribution of DON in the wheat milling process and wheat-based products, as well as the daily intake estimates for the Southern Brazilian population. The fractions of wheat grains (milled wheat, finished flour and bran) were produced in a mill. Additionally, wheat-derived products, such as pasta, bread and crackers were analyzed. The bran fraction had the highest mean concentration of DON (2278 μg kg-1), followed by milled wheat and finished flour (1895 μg kg-1 and 1305 μg kg-1). The distribution factor in the finished flour (69%) fraction demonstrates that DON was reduced when compared to milled wheat, by contrast of bran fraction that presents higher DON levels (120%). A percentage of 35% bran, 35% finished flour and 30% milled wheat samples would not be in compliance with future Brazilian regulations for DON levels. From the wheat-based products analyzed, 17% of whole bread and 10% of salted cracker products were contaminated with DON, with a median of 437 μg kg-1 and 624 μg kg-1, respectively. The finished flour was the fraction that most contributes to the daily intake of DON in Southern Brazil, representing 89.6% of the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Bread, cakes and biscuits were manufactured from flour containing deoxynivalenol (DON) and low concentrations of zearalenone (ZON) and nivalenol (NIV). The results show that these mycotoxins remain mostly unaffected during manufacture. Although the results indicate that the mycotoxins are largely stable and survive processing, when concentrations were determined on an 'as is' basis as stipulated in legislation, levels in finished products were usually lower than in the starting flour due to the dilution effect of other ingredients such as fat, sugar and water. Thus mean concentrations of DON in bread were reduced by about 35% and 39% in white and wholemeal bread respectively which are in close agreement with the reduction required by the regulations although the changes that occur during milling white and wholemeal flour from whole wheat also need to be taken into account. The reduction of DON during cake manufacture is greater than for bread because flour makes up only about 25% of the starting ingredients. However, in biscuit production, particularly for crackers for which flour constitutes about 90% of the recipe ingredients, the reduction indicated by the regulations is not achieved. It is concluded that for some commercial processes, the whole-wheat or flour ingredients used will need to contain DON levels lower than those set by legislation to ensure that the final products will still meet statutory limits. Limited results with consignments containing low concentrations of ZON and NIV suggest that their stability and survival are similar to those for DON. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

Before performing this study, a FBs method with liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection (ex. 335; em. 440 nm) was validated first. FBs were detected in 46.6% (108 samples), with values ranging from 66 to 7832 mu g kg(-1) for FB1 and 110 to 1201 mu g kg(-1) for FB2. The number of contaminated corn samples for FB1 and FB2 varied and often presented contamination of FB1 only. Per year of analysis, the numbers were: n = 22/8(FB1/FB2), 44/5(FB1/FB2), 25/12(FB1/FB2), 4(FB1), 6(FB1) and 7(FB1) in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The contamination percentage was 42.3/15.4, 59.5/6.8, 43.8/21.1, 36.4, 35.3 and 33.3%, respectively, during these years. Consumers can be exposed to these mycotoxins and their health can be at risk through the consumption of contaminated corn.},

Studies on mycotoxin contamination in agricultural products consumed as food in Turkey have been accelerated by the detection of aflatoxin and aflatoxigenic mould in nuts, pistachios, red pepper and dried figs. However, not much research has been performed to reveal the problems related to aflatoxin in maize flour in Turkey. In this study, maize flour samples were obtained from different vendors at bazaars (marketplace) in the province of Giresun, and the aflatoxin level was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography. In 11 of the 69 (16%) samples that were analysed, aflatoxin was detected in the range of 0.379-24.54 μg/kg total aflatoxin. The total aflatoxin level in one sample and the aflatoxin B1 level in two samples were found to be above the permissible toxin limits of Turkey and the European Union. The data obtained in this study are important in terms of human health, because aflatoxin B1 and G1 are powerful carcinogens known to cause liver cancer. Maize is known to be contaminated by aflatoxin. Moreover, as the prevalence of this in Turkish maize from the Black Sea region has not been previously studied, these results indicate the extent of human exposure from consuming locally produced Turkish maize. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Mould incidence and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination as well as proximate composition and minerals content of maize kernels from Swat Valley, North West Frontier Province of Pakistan was studied during the year, 2007. Results indicated that the mean moisture content of the kernels was within the recommended safe storage levels of <= 15%. Across the whole valley, Aspergillus. Fusar-Penicillium and Rhizopus were the most predominant fungal genera identified and amongst the mycotoxigenic species, Aspergillus flavus had the highest incidence. AFB1 content ranged from none to 30.921 mu g/kg with the average values of 14.94 and 16.22 mu g/kg for Upper and Lower Swat regions, respectively. Similar trend was observed for OTA with the contamination level ranged from <0.001 to 7.32 mu g/kg. A significant numbers of samples contained AFB1 and OTA levels above the safe limits as recommended by the USFDA and EU but on the average the results were within the safe limit. These results indicate that maize consumers in Swat Valley may be exposed to the danger of aflatoxins and ochratoxins poisoning. Thus, there is a need for policy makers to establish and enforce maize quality standards and regulations related to moulds and mycotoxins across the area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Currently, there are no set standards or quantitative guidelines available in the U.S. for arsenic levels in rice cereal, one of the most common first solid foods for infants. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the detected levels of inorganic arsenic (Asi) in rice cereal in the U.S. market are safe for consumption by infants and toddlers. A risk assessment was conducted based on literature reviews of the reported Asi in rice cereal from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) survey and the recommended daily intake of rice cereal by body weight, for infants and toddlers between four and 24 months old. As a part of risk management, a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for Asi in rice cereal was computed considering overall exposure sources including drinking water, infant formula, and other infant solid foods. Hazard quotients (HQs) for acute and chronic exposures were calculated based on the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s (ATSDR) Minimal Risk Level (MRL)acute (5.0 × 10-3 mg/kg/day) and MRLchronic (3.0 × 10-4 mg/kg/day). A cancer slope or potency factor of 1.5 mg/kg/day was used to predict an incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). Exposure assessment showed that the largest source of Asi for infants and toddlers between four and 24 months old was rice cereal (55%), followed by other infant solid food (19%), and drinking water (18%). Infant formula was the smallest source of Asi for babies (9%) at the 50th percentile based on Monte Carlo simulations. While HQacute were consistently below 1.0, HQchronic at the 50 and 75th percentiles exceeded 1.0 for both rice cereal and total sources. ILCR ranged from 10-6 (50th) to 10-5 (75th percentile). MCLs for Asi in rice cereal ranged from 0.0 (chronic) to 0.4 mg/kg (acute exposures). © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

C. africana was rapidly and reliably identified by microscopical and molecular analysis. Dihydroergosine was identified as the major ergot alkaloid. Dihydrolysergol and dihydroergotamine were identified for the first time as significant ergot alkaloid components within the C. africana sclerotia, thereby providing for the first time a proof for the natural occurrence of dihydroergotamine. The sorghum silages were found to be safe for feed consumption, since the ergot alkaloids and the regulated mycotoxins were below their regulated limits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The estimated daily intake (EDI) of DON through bread and pasta was evaluated in the inhabitants of Londrina City in northern Paraná State, Brazil. The average intake of these inhabitants was 0.79 μg/kg body weight (b.w.) for bread and 0.35 μg/kg b.w. for pasta. The total EDI was 1.13 μg/kg, which is above the Provisional Tolerable Daily Maximum Intake (PTDMI) of 1 μg/kg b.w.

   abstract = {Abstract Inorganic arsenic (As<inf>i</inf>) is a chronic, non-threshold carcinogen. Rice and rice-based products can be the major source of As<inf>i</inf> for many subpopulations. Baby rice, rice cereals and rice crackers are widely used to feed infants and young children. The As<inf>i</inf> concentration in rice-based products may pose a health risk for infants and young children. As<inf>i</inf> concentration was determined in rice-based products produced in the European Union and risk assessment associated with the consumption of these products by infants and young children, and compared to an identical US FDA survey. There are currently no European Union or United States of America regulations applicable to As<inf>i</inf> in food. However, this study suggests that the samples evaluated may introduce significant concentration of As<inf>i</inf> into infants' and young children's diets. Thus, there is an urgent need for regulatory limits on As<inf>i</inf> in food, especially for baby rice-based products. © 2015 The Authors.},

This compound was shown to be associated with a glomerulonephropathy involving an increase of immunoglobulin A in humans. This study assessed the occurrence of DON in wheat flour and the exposure of Brazilian teenagers, adults and elderly to this mycotoxin due to intake of wheat flour-based products. DON extraction in wheat flour was carried out by solid phase extraction and the quantification was performed by ultra-high proficiency liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. A total of 77.9% of all samples were positive for DON, with concentrations ranging from 73.50 to 2794.63 µg kg−1. The intake was calculated for the average and 90th percentile of the contamination levels of DON in foods based-wheat for teenagers, adults and elderly in Brazil, and compared with the provisional maximum tolerable daily intakes (PMTDI). Females of all age groups were exposed to DON at higher levels when compared to males in regard of consumption of breads and pastas. Teenagers were the main consumers of foods derived from wheat flour, with maximum probable daily intakes of 1.28 and 1.20 µg kg−1 b.w. day−1 for females and males, respectively. This population is at an increased risk of exposure to DON due to consumption of wheat flour-based foods in Brazil. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The aim of the study was to determine fungal and aflatoxin contamination in the rice samples to assess hazard from the presence of damaged grains. Presence of iron in discoloured rice grains was also assessed. Methods: Stored samples of paddy of PAU 201 rice variety were collected from six districts of Punjab, milled and analysed for presence of fungal and aflatoxin contamination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and Prussian blue staining was used to determine fungal spores and presence of iron, respectively. Results: Aflatoxin analysis of rice samples indicated that none exceeded the Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins and Residues) Regulations, 2011 tolerance limit of 30 μg/kg and majority of the samples had levels <15 μg/kg. The proportion of damaged grains exceeding the limit of 5 per cent was observed in 85.7 per cent of the samples. SEM and Prussian blue staining and EDX analysis of black tipped and pin point damaged rice grains did not show presence of fungal structures and presence of iron. Interpretation & conclusions: The results of the study indicated that the stored rice samples did not pose any health concern with respect to aflatoxin contamination as per the criteria laid down by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.},

The samples were prepared by simple one-step method and analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with heated-electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/HESI-MS/MS). Deoxynivalenol (DON) was the predominant mycotoxin for all analyzed samples followed by zearalenone (ZON) and T-2 toxin, with frequency of occurrence: 88.7%, 33.3% and 26.7%, respectively. Aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), HT-2 toxin, fumonisins B1 (FB1) as well as B2 (FB2) were below the limit of detection. All the samples complied with current European/Serbian legislation, except one sample that exceeded the DON maximum level of 750 μg/kg. In addition, mycotoxin intakes through consumption of wheat-based products were estimated for average adult consumers based on Serbian market basket and then compared with the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by Scientific Committee on Food of the European Union. The calculated intakes of ZON and T-2 were lower than the respective TDIs. However, intakes of DON were assessed to be close to the level of TDI for adults. This is the first study on the intake assessment for mycotoxins present in the wheat flour through the consumption of wheat-based products on the Serbian market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A multi-analyte LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 23 mycotoxins (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, fusarenon X, neosolaniol, 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, roquefortine C, HT-2 toxin, alternariol, T-2 toxin, FB1, FB2, FB3, zearalenone, aflatoxin G1, aflatoxin G2, aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2, sterigmatocystin, OTA, altenuene, alternariol monomethylether) was applied to different sorghum matrices. Of the 1533 analysed samples, 33% were contaminated with at least one of the following mycotoxins: aflatoxins, fumonisins, sterigmatocystin, Alternaria toxins, OTA and zearalenone. Country of origin, colour, source and collection period of sorghum samples significantly influenced the type, level and prevalence of mycotoxins. Sterigmatocystin (15%), fumonisins (17%) and aflatoxins (13%) were the most prevalent. FB1 (274 ± 585 µg/kg) had the highest mean concentration followed by FB2 (214 ± 308 µg/kg) while diacetoxyscirpenol (8.12 ± 19.2 µg/kg) and HT-2 (11.9 ± 0.00 µg/kg) had the lowest concentrations. Neosolaniol, fusarenon-X, 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, nivalenol and roquefortine C were not detected in any of the samples. Sudan had the lowest prevalence and mean concentration of all mycotoxins. Pink sorghum had the highest concentrations of fumonisins and aflatoxins. Mycotoxins from Aspergillus spp. and Alternaria spp. are the mycotoxins of concern in SSA grain sorghum with regard to prevalence, concentration and possible health risk from exposure. Based on the performed risk characterisation, daily consumption of sorghum containing aflatoxins, alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, sterigmatocystin and OTA could result in exceeding the established health-based guidance values for these toxins. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC},

Seventy three percent of the analyzed samples contained at least one mycotoxin. The highest occurrence was for enniatin B, 71% of the analyzed samples being positive (21-407 mu g kg(-1)). Regarding the legislated mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol was detected in 14% (111-1787 mu g kg(-1)) of the samples, while zearalenone was detected in 9% (51-1135 mu g kg(-1)). Only one sample was positive for neosolaniol. Concerning the co-occurrence, 42% of the samples were contaminated with two to five mycotoxins, the most frequent being the binary or tertiary combinations of enniatins. This is the first study applied to Romanian wheat grains and flour samples using a high sensitive multi-mycotoxins method, and which included also "emerging" mycotoxins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For the wheat samples, the influence of agricultural practices was assessed, whereas the results for the wheat-based products were used to calculate the estimated daily intake of emerging mycotoxins through wheat consumption for the Romanian population. ENB presented the highest incidence (41% in wheat and 32% in wheat-based products), with its maximum levels of 815 mu g kg(-1) and 170 mu g kg(-1) in wheat and wheat-based products, respectively. The correlation between the concentrations of ENB and ENB1 in wheat grain samples and farm practices (organic or conventional) was confirmed statistically (p < 0.05). This is the first study that provides comprehensive information about the influence of agricultural practice on emerging Fusarium mycotoxin presence in Romanian wheat samples and the estimated daily intake of ENs and BEA present in wheat-based products for human consumption commercialized in Romania.},

   abstract = {Rice is an important cereal but it is often contaminated with aflatoxins (AFs). The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify AF (B1, B2, G1, and G2) in 67 rice samples cultivated in Mexico and Spain, and from imported crops collected in 2008 and 2009. The methodology was validated, the rice samples were concentrated and purified with immunoaffinity columns and were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The average total AF (AFt) in the Spanish rice was 37.3 μg/kg, the range was from 1.6 to 1383 μg/kg, the most contaminated samples being from San Juan de Aznalfarache, Sevilla (AFt = 138.6 μg/kg), from Tortosa, Tarragona (AFt = 104.6 μg/kg), and Calasparra, Murcia (AFt = 103.9 μg/kg). The rice imported from France to Spain had AFt of 26.6 μg/kg and from Pakistan AFt of 18.4 μg/kg, showing less AF contamination than the local one. The rice which originated from Mexico contained (AFt = 16.9 μg/kg), and those imported from the United States (AFt = 14.4 μg/kg) and Uruguay (AFt = 15.6 μg/kg). The imported rice had better quality in terms of the presence of AFs. Practical Application: Rice is both a nutrient and a health risk, because it can be contaminated with aflatoxins that are proven carcinogens. The present study helps humans to know the state of their food and to prevent and avoid aflatoxins. © 2013 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

Since AFM1 has been evaluated as a possible human carcinogen, the cancer risk arising from AFM 1 contamination in milk is a serious problem in food safety. To evaluate the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk, it is necessary to analyze the risk factors of AFB1 contamination in corn provided for concentrated feed in Japan. The AFM1 level in domestic raw bulk milk was measured at three sampling times, January, February and June in 2004. The AFB1 contamination in corn supplied to cows was determined at the same time as the sampling of raw milk. The AFM1 contamination levels in milk in January, February and June 2004 were 0.011, 0.007 and 0.005 ng/g, respectively. The AFB1 contamination level in the corn of the concentrated feed was higher from October of 2003 to February of 2004 than from April to June in 2004. This study provides evidence that AFM1 contamination level in milk is parallel to that of AFB1 in corn of concentrated feed, so monitoring of the AFB1 level in corn is important to prevent the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk in Japan.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination in rice is generally lower than in other cereals such as corn or wheat. However, over 65% of the population in China consumes rice as a staple food. Due to the diversity of the climate across China, the southern region is characterized by high temperatures and humidities, especially in rainy season. Such conditions are optimal for the growth of fungi. The accumulative and transferrable characteristics of fungi mycotoxins pose a great potential threat as confirmed by high incidences of liver cancer in the Yangtze delta region. Major mycotoxins identified in China are aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, as well as fumonisins. The contents of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in rice are varied among different provinces and regions and generally less than 5 μg/kg. Although high incidences of positive aflatoxins samples have widely been detected, few samples were detected as exceeding the national's maximum residue limit (10 μg/kg). Limited information is available on risk assessment of human health hazards of mycotoxins in rice, children should be paid more attention to due to their having the highest mycotoxins exposure level, although the risks are generally at low levels from rice. Mycotoxins are mainly distributed in the outer layer of the paddy rice (also called rough rice, referring to whole rice grain with the hulls), and the AFB1 content in bran is 8.4 times greater than that in brown rice (hulled rice). Further investigation should focus on isolation and identification of mycotoxins-producing fungal strains, especially unknown mycotoxigenic fungal strains determination. Infection resistant rice breeding of mycotoxigenic fungal species may be a fundamental approach to guaranteeing rice safety in China. © 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®},

   abstract = {Soils used for rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation in some areas contain high concentrations of arsenic (As) due to irrigation with groundwater containing As and intensive use of agrochemicals or industrial residues containing As. To restrict rice uptake of As in these soils, approaches to reduce As input and bioavailability must be considered. One approach to reduce As input into rice soils or uptake by rice is cultivating rice under aerobic, intermittent flooding, or alternate wetting and drying (AWD) conditions, rather than in submerged soils, or use of irrigation water low in As. For reducing As bioavailability in soil, aerobic or AWD rice culture and application of biochar, sulfur (S), and/or rice polish to soil are promising. Moreover, use of As-hyperaccumulating plant species (e.g., Pteris vittata L.) in rotation or combinations with favourable plant species (e.g., Azolla, Chlorella, or Nannochloropsis species) can also be promoted, in addition to using rice cultivars that are tolerant to As. Though applications of high doses of phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), and silicon (Si) fertilizers have shown promise in many instances, these methods have to be practiced carefully, because negative effects have also been reported, although such incidents are rare. Major factors affecting As speciation and bioavailability in soil are chemical properties such as redox status, pH, and Fe, P, Si, and S concentrations, physical properties such as texture and organic matter, and biological properties such as methylation activity by soil microorganisms. However, as many of these factors interact, long-term examination under field conditions is needed before measures are recommended for and implemented in farmers' fields. © 2018 Soil Science Society of China},

The most frequent fungal contaminants belonged to Aspergillus and Fusarium, and maize was the most contaminated cereal. The main toxigenic species identified were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium graminearum, and Fusarium culmorum in all cereals and Fusarium verticillioides in maize. The presence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB 1), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), fumonisins, and chratoxin A was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More than 90% of the samples were contaminated with at least one toxin. Around 30% of maize samples were contaminated with AFB1, and in 20% of these samples the level of toxin exceeded that allowed by European Union regulations. In 48 and 42% of samples, levels of DON and ZEA, respectively, exceeded those allowed by the European Union. Neither fumonisins nor ochratoxin A were found in samples from any year or cereal. These results indicate that cereals produced in Romania have a particular pattern of mycoflora and mycotoxin contamination because DON and ZEA in addition to AFB1 were found.Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protectior.},

To examine the effect of seasonal changes, summer and winter sampling was performed with standard sampling methods. Methods: A total of 200 flour samples were collected from 25 factories. HPLC method with immunoaffinity chromatography was used to measure aflatoxin types (G2, G1, B2 and B1). Statistical analysis was performed by the Pearson correlation test, One-way ANOVA and multivariate regression analysis. Results: Mean total aflatoxin levels of samples were 0.82 and 1.99 ng/g in summer and winter, respectively. Aflatoxin B1 levels were detected in 3.1%, 7.4% over permissible limits by worldwide regulations in samples collected in summer and winter, respectively. Aflatoxins in winter were higher than summer. The highest frequency of aflatoxin contamination in winter was B2 (98%) and in summer G1 (51%). The relationship between humidity and rate of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin was significant in winter. Results of multivariate regression were showed the strongest relationship with humidity and aflatoxin level. Despite the contamination of flour samples, there was no contamination higher than the standard limit of Iran Standard Institute. But it was significantly higher than similar studies from other regions. Conclusions: Therefore, with regard to negative impacts of aflatoxin on health, aflatoxin contamination should be considered in future programs. Decrease of aflatoxin contamination may be made practical through reducing wheat storage duration and controlling humidity.},

Actually, there is no clear-cut trend in favour of organic cereals or in favour of their conventional counterparts. In contrast to older studies, most of the recent ones lead to the identification of slight differences between the two types of products. In addition, the high variation in mycotoxin content between the organic and conventional modes of production (even within the same year) makes comparison less obvious and calls for the use of quite powerful statistical tools, a call whic is not always met in the published studies. Hence, the interpretation of results requires a critical approach. The mycotoxin exposure assessment for consumers of organic and conventional cereal-based products is mainly carried out using data gathered from raw cereals. As a consequence the exposure levels are overestimated because cereal processing is not taken into account. Here also it was not possible to identify a clear trend in favour of either organic or conventional foodstuffs. However, it seems interesting to monitor both production systems because uncontrolled factors can sometimes play an important role and because production techniques and farmers' skills have highly improved.},

Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd) and Arsenic (As) are mentioned among the samples of the most dangerous heavy metals and exceeding from concentration of maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) can have serious side effects as well as carcinogenic properties. Method: 210 samples of seven brands of internal and imported high consumption packed rice in Iran were selected each brand whereof consisted of 30 samples which were evaluated in terms of contamination with Pb, Cd and As. The evaluation was performed through graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry methods; afterwards, their concentrations were compared to MAC. Finally, their safety was calculated for the human health. Results and conclusion: The average concentrations of Pb, Cd and As in high consumption rice cultivated in or imported to Iran were 0.061, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg respectively. The results of this study showed that the weekly intake of these heavy metals in all rice brands was below provisional tolerable weekly intake. These findings suggest that all evaluated high consumption brands are below 1 in terms of health risk index and are safe for the human health in the present study.},

   abstract = {Thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole insecticides have been important tools for controlling pests in rice. However, food safety issues related to pesticide residues are important to consider with a food crop such as rice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole residues in rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The study was conducted during the 2012 cropping season at the Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Research, David R. Wintermann Rice Research Station, near Eagle Lake, TX, USA. Rice was planted on May 5, 2012, using the cultivar "Presidio". Pesticide applications were performed at 5, 15, 25, and 35 days after flowering (DAF) using 1 and 2 times the recommended rate of 30 g active ingredient (ai) ha-1 for thiamethoxam and 30 g ai ha-1 for chlorantraniliprole. Sequentially, two treatments using the insecticides at recommended rate were applied at 5 and 25 DAF and at 5, 25, and 35 DAF. Insecticide residues were analyzed in different sample fractions: rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The samples were subjected to extraction using an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) technique. Sample aliquots were analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 × 10-5 mg kg-1. Residues of thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole were detected in rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains, and the quantified values were greater in hull and in rice bran. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Premixes for medicated feedstuffs are considered to be veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) prepared in advance with a view to the infsequent manufacture of medicated feedstuffs. Medicated feedstuffs should be prepared only from market authorized premixes and premixes for medicated feedstuffs can be used only as prescribed medicines. Apart from active infstances, premixes contain carriers which have a role in the homogenization of medicated feedstuffs. Wheat bran as a carrier may be a source of different, potentially harmful or toxic infstances e.g. aflatoxin. In our study, 15 different batches of premixes with a wheat bran component were tested for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The samples tested showed contamination with AFB1 ranging from 1.5 to 35 ng/g (mean = 18.79 ng/g). However, no correlation between AFB1 levels and the month of collection or season of production was observed. Considering the composition of the premix, the only possible source of contamination with AFB1was wheat bran. Contamination probably occurred before the production of the premix, probably in the field or during storage. Concentrations of active infstances and citric acid (a neutralising agent for mycotoxins) were in accordance with the producer's declaration. Our discovery of AFB1 in the tested premixes was in contravention of the definition and primary role of veterinary medicinal products. In this study, we would like to highlight the need for monitoring raw materials of biological origin for premix production. Even though carriers are not pharmacologically active infstances, an efficient method for controlling potential contaminants such asmycotoxins or their toxic components should be proposed, with the aim of protecting animal health, consumers, employees and end-users in the production of veterinary medicinal products.},

   abstract = {Rice can contain a relatively high amount of arsenic (As). We evaluated total and inorganic As concentrations in 39 samples of different types of rice sold in Spain. The analyses were performed in raw rice and in rice cooked by boiling to dryness in water spiked with As(V) (0.1-1 mu g mL(-1)). In raw rice, inorganic As represented 27-93% of total As: total As = 0.188 +/- 0.078 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw); inorganic As = 0.114 +/- 0.046 mu g g(-1) dw. After cooking, the rice retained between 45% and 107% of the As(V) added to the cooking water, and the inorganic As concentrations ranged between 0.428 mu g g(-1) dw (0.1 mu g mL(-1) in the cooking water) and 3.89 mu g g(-1) dw (1.0 mu g mL(-1) in the cooking water). For raw rice, the inorganic As intake of the Spanish population (16 g raw rice/day) remains below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the WHO (2.1 mu g inorganic As/day/kg body weight). In rice cooked with water contaminated with As(V), this cereal intake is sufficient to attain the TDI. The results reveal the need to consider the determination of inorganic As and the influence of cooking when evaluating the risks associated with the consumption of rice.},

The results, calculated in mgkg1 (wet weight) for each sample, revealed the general scenario of food safety in Taiwan: As (0.005-12.04), Cd (&lt;50.0005-2.22), Cr (0.014-6.95), Cu (0.012-8.70), Pb (&lt;0.001-0.64), Se (50.001-1.29) and Zn (0.020-67.02). Three food samples were identified with As concentrations higher than regulatory limits: a dietary supplement sample and a seaweed sample with As concentrations that exceeded the limit of Taiwan's health food standard of 2mg kg1, and a canned eel sample with an As concentration that exceeded the limit of Canada's fish standard of 3.5 mgkg1. This study suggests that the estimated intakes of these seven trace elements from the consumption of foods containing Monascus pose little risk, as the traceelement contents in the majority of samples were lower than the permissible/tolerable intakes per week according to the guidelines recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). Moreover, their concentrations in foods containing Monascus differ widely for different food varieties, suggesting that external contaminants and raw materials are the main sources of trace elements. This study shows that ICP-MS is a simple method proposed for the determination of As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Se, Cu, and Zn in foods containing Monascus. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

Two-hundred maize kernel samples, collected from 20 major maize growing areas in Ethiopia were analyzed for the identity, species composition and prevalence of Fusarium species and fumonisin contamination. On average, 38 % (range: 16 to 68 %) of maize kernels were found to be contaminated by different fungal species. Total of eleven Fusarium spp. were identified based on morphological characteristics and by sequencing the partial region of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) gene. Fusarium verticillioides was the dominant species associated with maize kernels (42 %), followed by F. graminearum species complex (22.5 %) and F. pseudoanthophilium (13.4 %). The species composition and prevalence of Fusarium species differed among the areas investigated. Fusarium species composition was as many as eight and as few as four in some growing area. The majority of the maize samples (77 %) were found positive for fumonisin, with concentrations ranging from 25 μg kg−1 to 4500 μg kg−1 (mean: 348 μg kg−1 and median: 258 μg kg−1). Slight variation in fumonisin concentration was also observed among areas. Overall results indicate widespread occurrence of several Fusarium species and contamination by fumonisin mycotoxins. These findings are useful for intervention measures to reduce the impact of the main fungal species and their associated mycotoxins, by creating awareness and implementation of good agricultural practices. © 2016, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.},

Besides enniatins A, A1, B and B1, also deoxynivalenol and its conjugated form (deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside) were determined in almost all tested cereal-based samples. Significant decline of enniatins occurred within all technologies, with the largest drop in their concentrations observed in the brewing process. While enniatins were not detectable in final beers, they were almost quantitatively transferred to spent grains, probably because of their limited water solubility. Regarding bread baking, levels of enniatins decreased down to 30% of their concentration in the initial flour used for baking. In this case, degradation at higher temperatures might be assumed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Global food safety depends on continuous monitoring of food contaminants such as mycotoxins in cereals and cereal-derived products. Here, we combine this type of investigation with quantitative occurrence data on Fusarium infestation of these products in extensive correlation studies. Finally, this contributes to a thorough understanding of the presence, origin and physiology of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) related mycotoxins and the correlations within their ranks. Two hundred and thirty-seven samples were analyzed from diverse cereal matrices, representing the most important stages of the cereal food and feed chain in Belgium. Food, feed and non-processed field samples were investigated, with a strong emphasis on whole-grain food products. Two approaches were pursued to estimate the full scope of FHB and its repercussions: UPLC-MS/MS was applied to detect twelve different mycotoxins, and Q-PCR was used to measure the presence of ten Fusarium species. We found that different matrices have different characteristic contamination profiles, and extensive correlation studies identified certain mycotoxins for future assessment (e.g. moniliformin produced by the Fusarium avenaceum/. Fusarium tricinctum species group). The investigated harvest year of 2012 yielded many non-processed field materials containing elevated levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), while even in a so-called DON-year less prevalent toxins such as T-2 and HT-2 might be considered problematic due to their consistent co-occurrence with related mycotoxins. Our data illustrate complex interactions between the many Fusarium species that are responsible for FHB and their mycotoxins. Correlation studies demonstrate that consistent co-occurrence of mycotoxins is not to be neglected, and pinpoint issues for future surveillance and legislation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

None of the remaining six analytes was found in any matrices, which suggests that, if at all present, the concentrations of these latter metabolites are very low and, hence, do not impose any danger to consumers.

   abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the major diseases of wheat (both common and durum wheat) caused by various fungi including Microdochium nivale and different Fusarium species. Most of the Fusarium species associated with FHB (mainly F. graminearum, F. culmorum and F. sporotrichioides), under favourable environmental conditions, can produce various toxic secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) that can contaminate grains. The major Fusarium mycotoxins that can occur in wheat and derived products are deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and zearalenone. Processing has generally significant effects on the levels of mycotoxins in the final products. Deoxynivalenol is typically concentrated in the bran coat which is removed in the production of semolina; consequently, a consistent reduction of deoxynivalenol levels has been observed during each of the processing steps, from raw durum wheat to pasta production. To allow monitoring programs and protect consumers' health, several analytical methods have been developed for Fusarium mycotoxins, based on chromatographic or immunometric techniques. The European Union has established maximum permitted levels for some Fusarium mycotoxins in cereals and cereal-based products (including unprocessed durum wheat, bran, wheat flour, and pasta). Recommendations for the prevention and reduction of Fusarium mycotoxins contamination in cereals based on identification of critical risk factors and crop management strategies have been published by the Codex Alimentarius and the European Commission. © 2010 AACC International, Inc.},

Between 2007 and 2010, 527 samples were obtained from 17 cantons. Between 2011 and 2014, 159 samples were collected from the canton Berne. The most frequent toxins detected were deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and nivalenol (NIV). The overall mean DON content in all samples was 607 μg/kg, and 11% exceeded the European limit for unprocessed cereals for foodstuffs (1250 μg/kg). For ZEA (mean 39 μg/kg), 7% exceeded the respective limit (100 μg/kg), and the mean content of NIV (no limit established) was 15 μg/kg. Between the years, the ratio of mycotoxin-contaminated samples ranged between 52% and 98% for DON, 9% and 43% for ZEA and 0% and 49% for NIV. The yearly mean contents varied substantially between 68 and 1310 μg/kg for DON, 5 and 56 μg/kg for ZEA and 6 and 29 μg/kg for NIV. The geographic origin showed a significant effect on DON and ZEA contamination, but was inconsistent between the years. This study has shown that the majority of Swiss-produced wheat is, in terms of Fusarium toxins, fit for human consumption and feed purposes. Nevertheless, depending on the year, high toxin contents can be expected, an issue that growers, cereal collection centres and the food industry have to deal with to ensure food and feed safety. © 2017 by the authors.

The highest and the lowest concentrations were observed in fish (mean 2,832 ng g(-1), ww) collected from Kandal province and cattle stomach (1.86 +/- A 1.10 ng g(-1), ww) collected from Kratie, respectively. The daily intake of arsenic via food consumption was 604, 9.70 and 136 mu g day(-1) in Kandal, Kratie and Kampong Cham, respectively. The arsenic dietary intake in Kandal ranked No. 1 among all the 17 compared countries or regions. Fish consumption contributed the greatest proportion of total arsenic daily intake in Kandal (about 63.0 %) and Kampong Cham (about 69.8 %). It is revealed to be a much more important exposure pathway than drinking water for residents in Kampong Cham. The results of risk assessment suggested that the residents in Cambodia, particularly for people in Kandal province, suffer high public health risks due to consuming arsenic-contaminated food.},

   abstract = {Heavy metal contamination in polished rice grains collected from Hunan Province, Southern China, has been investigated in this study. The concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in rice were determined by microwave-assisted digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry method. In order to evaluate the correlations among heavy metals, statistical analyses including Pearson’s correlation analysis, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed. Three distinct clusters were classified by the hierarchical cluster analysis approach. In the principal component analysis, three principle components were extracted with the eigenvalue >1.0. The spatial distribution of heavy metals was predicted by the ordinary kriging interpolation. Cu and Ni with similar distribution patterns could be primarily originated from geogenic source. The hot-spot areas in the distribution patterns of Mn, Pb and Zn could be mainly related to mining and smelting activities. Cd and Co might be derived from the combination of natural existence and anthropogenic sources. The chronic non-carcinogenic effect on local rice consumers from exposure to heavy metals was estimated by the target hazard quotient. The average target hazard quotient values of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were 1.754, 0.367, 0.003, 0.544, 0.165, 0.775, 0.228, 0.049 and 0.481, respectively. The target hazard quotient value of Cd exceeded the threshold value suggesting high potential health risk to residents in Hunan Province through rice consumption. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

   abstract = {The health risks arising from heavy metal pollution (HMP) in agricultural soils have attracted global attention, and research on the accumulation of heavy metals in soil-plant systems is the basis for human health risk assessments. This review studied the accumulation of seven typical heavy metals-Cd, Cr, As, Pb, Hg, Cu, and Zn-in soil-corn and soil-wheat systems. The findings indicated that, in general, wheat was more likely to accumulate heavy metals than corn. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of the seven heavy metals in wheat and corn grains decreased exponentially with their average concentrations in soil. The seven heavy metals were ranked as follows, in ascending order of accumulation in corn grains: Pb < Cr < Zn < As < Cu < Cd < Hg. As for the order of accumulation in wheat grains, their ranking was as follows: Zn < Pb < Cr < Cu < As < Hg < Cd. The minimum BCFs of Cd, Cr, As, Pb, Hg, Cu, and Zn in corn grains were 0.054, 6.65 x 10(-4), 7.94 x 10(-4), 0.0044, 0.028, 0.13, and 0.19, respectively. The corresponding BCFs values for wheat grains were 0.25, 0.0045, 5.42 x 10(-4), 0.009, 4.03 x 10(-4), 0.11, and 0.054, respectively.},

   abstract = {69 maize germ samples from North China Plain, 40 processed products of maize germs obtained in lab, 30 crude corn oils from factories and 40 refined corn oils from supermarkets in China were analyzed of deoxynivalenol (DON) by HPLC combined with ultraviolet detection and immunoaffinity column. 95.7% of maize germs were contaminated by DON. The average content was 449.0 μg/kg. The average of DON in processed products of maize germs including solvent extracted oil, cold-press oil, meal and cake was 163.7, 113.1, 1111.5 and 1175.2 μg/kg, respectively. Only 20% of crude corn oil and 12.5% of refined corn oil were contaminated by DON with the range of 67.5–340.5 μg/kg and 57.1–207.5 μg/kg, respectively. During the production of corn oil, solvent extraction oil had a larger amount of DON than pressing oil. The contamination of DON in corn oil was not serious or widespread, which indicated a low risk of health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, in worldwide approximately 25% of crops are affected by mycotoxins annually, especially in feeds with fumonisins(FUM). Moreover, the exact mechanism of FUM toxicity is not completely established. This paper gives an overview about the occurrence, toxicity, rapid non-invasive analysis, and detoxification of FUM in maize and its feeds. Due to economic losses engendered by FUM and its impact on animal and human health, several strategies for detecting mycotoxins with non-invasive methods and detoxifying contaminated feeds have been described. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are secondary fungal metabolites that can contaminate stored foods and lead to various complications. Golestan province has a humid climate so on it is considered as a high risk area for fungal contamination of wheat products, therefore this study was aimed to evaluate the levels of fumonisin (FB) and zearalenone (ZEA) contamination in wheat, stored in the province's silages which has a humid climate. 35 samples of stored wheat were collected from silages of 14 cities in the province. FB and ZEA were extracted from samples and later their levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay method by the commercially available kits. Fungal mycoflora of the samples was identified too. 31 out of 35 samples were contaminated by ZEA, while only 3 samples had FB contamination. Temperature or relative humidity had no effect on the prevalence or concentration of these toxins. The mean +/- SD for ZEA and FB were 3.77 +/- 2.46 ng/g and 0.034 +/- 0.11 ng/g, respectively which were lower than the maximum tolerated level for mycotoxins in food and feed. 29 out of 35 samples (82.84%) had one of four fungi types which went under detection. The detected levels of FB and ZEA in wheat samples of this province are lower compared with other similar studies in Iran and particularly northeastern of Iran. Despite the low concentrations in our study, it is recommended to monitor the occurrence of ZEA and FB in wheat and wheat products to ensure safety and consequently improved public health.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the dietary exposure of Shanghai residents to a compound of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-Ac-DON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-Ac-DON) through wheat flour. METHODS: DON, 3-Ac-DON and 15-Ac-DON in wheat flour collected from 2011 to 2013 were respectively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. (HPLC-MS/MS) method and the total content of the compound was calculated. Dietary intake assessments of the compound through wheat flour were carried out in combination of wheat flour consumption data of Shanghai residents with the compound content data using both the point estimate method and the probabilistic assessment method. Group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake(PMTDI, 1 jg/(kg BW- d) )of the compound was used to assess the risk of the exposure. RESULTS: (1) At the mean and 50th percentile consumption level of wheat flour, the dietary exposure of people to the compound accounted for 18%-83% of PMTDI based on different content levels (mean and the 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles) of the compound. At the 95th percentile consumption level of wheat flour, the exposure was 1.08-2.55 times higher than PMTDI based on different toxin levels (mean and the 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles). (2) 89.99% of total Shanghai residents, 87.00% of Shanghai wheat flour consumers, and 76.55% of Shanghai residents under 15 years old had a daily exposure to the compound lower than PMTDI. CONCLUSION: The dietary exposure of Shanghai residents to the compound of DON, 3-Ac-DON and 15-Ac-DON increased along with the increase of wheat flour consumption. Most of the residents were safe through wheat flour consumption, but still 10.01% of the population was at risk, and residents under 15 years old were a high-risk group for the compound exposure.},

   abstract = {The contamination levels of beauvericin and four enniatins, A, A1, B and B1, in 207 samples of wheat flour and corn grits on the Japanese market were determined by an analytical method based on LC-MS/MS. The toxins were extracted from samples with acetonitrile–water (85:15, v/v) and then purified with C18 cartridges. The method was validated in a single laboratory using spiked samples at two levels; the recovery of the five toxins ranged from 91.1% to 113.8%. Enniatin B was frequently detected in imported wheat flour (81.8%) and domestic wheat flour (85.6%), and the highest concentration of enniatin B was present in a domestic wheat sample (633 μg kg−1). In corn grits, beauvericin was found in 34% of the samples, but enniatins were not detected at all. The maximum concentration of beauvericin in corn grits was 26.1 μg kg−1. Deoxynivalenol and nivalenol in the same samples were determined by a method using an immunoaffinity column. Co-contamination of deoxynivalenol and enniatins was observed in 61% of the imported wheat samples and in 58% of the domestic wheat samples. These results suggest the need for a risk assessment for cyclic depsipeptide mycotoxins in Japan and a study on the synergistic effect of deoxynivalenol and enniatins. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this study, sequence analyses of conserved DNA regions of fungi and bacteria combined with determination of trichothecenes and aflatoxins revealed the microbiome and mycotoxins of wheat from different silo positions (top, middle, and bottom) and storage times (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). The fungal community in wheat on the first day of storage (T0) included 105 classified species (81 genera) and 41 unclassified species. Four species had over 10% of the relative abundance: Alternaria alternata (12%), Filobasidium floriforme (27%), Fusarium graminearum (12%), and Wallemia sebi (12%). Fungal diversity and relative abundance of Fusarium in wheat from top silo positions were significantly lower than at other silo positions during storage. Nivalenol and deoxynivalenol in wheat were 13–34% higher in all positions at 3 months compared to T0, and mycotoxins in wheat from middle and bottom positions at 6 to 12 months were 24–57% higher than at T0. The relative abundance of toxigenic Aspergillus and aflatoxins were low at T0 and during storage. This study provides information on implementation and design of fungus and mycotoxin management strategies as well as prediction models. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

They are secondary metabolites which considered as one of the threatening factors of food and feed consumer health. In this study the possible presence of aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2 and total aflatoxin) in rice bran were evaluated. In order to determine of aflatoxins and contamination of the samples with toxigenic fungi, especially A. flavus and A. parasiticus, 30 rice bran samples were collected from different factories in Mazandran province, northern Iran. Samples containing 15 specimens were conserved for one year in the storage and the other one was not subjected to storage. Aflatoxins were extracted, purified and finally quantified by high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that almost all collected samples contained aflatoxins. The averages of total aflatoxins in new and old rice bran were found to be 18 and 17 μg/kg, respectively. No significant difference was obtained between total aflatoxin rate in new and old samples. The correlation between culture results and aflatoxins production were significantly observed only in old samples (P<0.05). The most common isolated fungi were Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp, Mucor spp and Rizopus spp. These results confirmed that under study bran rice were contaminated with aflatoxins and different toxigenic fungi. So animals, especially ruminants, are in danger to be affected by contaminated feeds. © IDOSI Publications, 2010.},

   abstract = {Rice is a potentially important route of human exposure to arsenic, especially in populations with rice-based diets. However, arsenic toxicity varies greatly with species. The initial purpose of the present study was to evaluate arsenic speciation in U.S. rice. Twenty-four samples containing high levels of arsenic and produced in different regions of the U.S were selected from a previous market-basket survey. Arsenite and dimethyl arsinic acid (DMA) were the major species detected. DMA increased linearly with increasing total As but arsenite remained fairly constant at similar to 0.1 mg kg(-1), showing that rice high in As was dominated by DMA. A similar result was obtained when our data was combined with other published speciation studies for U.S. rice. However, when all published speciation data for rice was analyzed a second population dominated by inorganic As and lower levels of DMA was found. We thus categorized rice into DMA and Inorganic As types. Rice from the U.S. was predominantly the DMA type, as were single samples from Australia and China, whereas rice from Asia and Europe was the Inorganic As type. We suggest that methylation of As occurs within rice and that genetic differences lead to the two rice types. Insufficient understanding of DMA toxicity precludes a firm assessment of the relative health risks associated with the two rice types but, based on current knowledge, we suggest that the DMA rice type is likely to be less of a health risk than the Inorganic As rice type and, on this basis, rice from the U.S. may be safer than rice from Asia and Europe.},

   abstract = {Background: Fusarium species are common fungal contaminants of maize and a number of them can produce mycotoxin fumonisins. China is one of the largest maize producers in the world. This study investigated the contamination of maize samples from three areas in eastern China by Fusarium and fumonisin-producing fungi as well as their fumonisin-producing potential. Results: A total of 22 Fusarium strains were isolated, 19 of which were able to produce fumonisin. Among the 19 strains, 16 belonged to F. verticillioides, two to F. subglutinans and one to F. proliferatum. The majority (17/19) of the fumonisin-forming strains were high FB1 producers, which is a potential health risk for the population in these areas. Fusarium contamination in samples from the mideastern area was the most serious (11 Fusarium strains, with nine producing fumonisin, isolated from 24 samples), followed by the northeastern area (nine Fusarium strains, with all nine producing fumonisin, isolated from 21 samples) and the southeastern area (two Fusarium strains, with one producing fumonisin, isolated from 19 samples). Conclusion: Although the overall levels of FBs and contamination by fumonisin-producing fungi in corn samples were not serious, the contaminating Fusarium strains possessed fairly strong toxicogenic ability and potential risk for food safety. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {This study is based on one of the metallurgical and Power Plant Industrial Park as the study area. A total of 90 wheat kernel samples were collected. Pb and Cd concentrations were measured by inductively plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The spatial distribution of heavy metal concentration in wheat kernel was predicted by Ordinary Krigging methods. The edible safety of wheat and dietary exposure risk of local residents were assessed by Target Hazard Quentient (THQ). In order to explore the level of Pb and Cd contamination in wheat kernel in the studied area, the health risk of local residents via dietary Pb and Cd exposure were assessed. The results showed that the concentration of Pb (68.6%) and Cd (34.3%) in the wheat samples exceeded maximum permissible levels (GB 2762-2012). The concentration of Pb and Cd proved to be significantly higher within 1 000 m in the southeast of the smelter. The concentration of Pb and Cd in wheat decreased gradually with distance from the smelter. The THQ of Pb estimated merely for wheat was 1.05 and 1.35 for adults and children, while the THQ of Cd was 0.72 and 0.92 for adults and children, respectively. The wheat kernel in the studied area was polluted to some extent. The results of spatial distribution of Pb and Cd concentrations in wheat kernel in the studied area indicated that the smelter was the main source of heavy metal contamination of wheat. The risk exposure to Pb of local inhabitants via consumption of wheat could not be accepted. The risk for children was greater than adults. The risk exposure to Cd of local inhabitants via consumption of wheat could be accepted. © 2016, Dept. of JCCOA. All right reserved.},

   abstract = {A total of 181 wheat flour and 142 wheat-based foods including dried noodle, steamed bread and bread collected in China were analyzed for alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tentoxin (TEN) and tenuazonic acid (TeA) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. TeA was the predominant toxin found in 99.4% wheat flour samples at levels ranging from 1.76 μg/kg to 520 μg/kg. TEN was another Alternaria toxin frequently detected in wheat flour samples (97.2%) at levels between 2.72 μg/kg and 129 μg/kg. AOH and AME were detected in 11 (6.1%) samples at levels ranging from 16.0 μg/kg to 98.7 μg/kg (AOH) and in 165 (91.2%) samples with a range between 0.320 μg/kg and 61.8 μg/kg (AME). AOH was quantified at higher levels than AME with the ratio of AOH/AME ranging from 1.0 to 3.7. Significant linear regressions of correlation in toxin concentrations were observed between AOH and AME, AME and TeA, TEN and TeA, AOH+AME and TeA. At an average and 95th percentile, dietary exposure to AOH and AME in the Chinese general population and different age subgroups exceeded the relevant threshold value of toxicological concern (TTC), with the highest exposure found in children which deserves human health concern. TEN and TeA seem unlikely to be health concerns for the Chinese via wheat-based products but attention should be paid to synergistic or additive effects of TeA with AOH, AME, TEN and a further assessment will be performed once more data on toxicity-guided fractionation of the four toxins are available. It is necessary to conduct a systemic surveillance of Alternaria toxins in raw and processed foods in order to provide the scientific basis for making regulations on these toxins in China. © 2015 Zhao et al.

In view of different regions, the north-centre region has a higher residual than the south, so as to the detection rate. The assessment model for health risk is used to analyze the DDTs in rice samples. On the whole, the health risk in research area is still in low level. On the regional differences, the north-centre area is in a higher risky than the south. In view of food cycle biomagnifications, the DDTs pollution threatens the health of residents. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Rice straws are widely used in Daqu (starter) preparation for Maotai-flavour liquor brewing to provide adequate thermal insulation, water retention and aeration. As the straws have direct contact with the Daqu during its preparation, the microorganisms carried by the straws can be transferred to the Daqu. In this study, yellow pigment-producing strains were isolated from the rice straws using a dilution plate method. Most of these strains were characterized as toxoflavin-producing Burkholderia spp. by 16S rRNA sequencing, toxA gene-specific PCR and toxoflavin detection. The PCR assays revealed the existence of Burkholderia in the Daqu samples. The toxoflavin content in a number of Daqu samples was determined using HPLC. The highest observed content of toxoflavin in the Daqu was >8mg/kg, close to its LD<inf>50</inf>. Although no toxoflavin was detected in the distilled liquor, the safety problem regarding the use of rice straws in Daqu preparation is still noteworthy, since Burkholderia and toxoflavin can be transferred and can accumulate during the brewing process. The results can contribute to a further assessment of the contamination risk in liquor brewing caused by Burkholderia and to safer production in this traditional process. © 2015 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.},

   abstract = {Two approaches were undertaken to characterize the arsenic (As) content of Chinese rice. First, a national market basket survey (n = 240) was conducted in provincial capitals, sourcing grain from China's premier rice production areas. Second, to reflect rural diets, paddy rice (n = 195) directly from farmers fields were collected from three regions in Hunan, a key rice producing province located in southern China. Two of the sites were within mining and smeltery districts, and the third was devoid of large-scale metal processing industries. Arsenic levels were determined in all the samples while a subset (n = 33) were characterized for As species, using a new simple and rapid extraction method suitable for use with Hamilton PRP-X100 anion exchange columns and HPLC-ICP-MS. The vast majority (85%) of the market rice grains possessed total As levels &lt; 150 ng g-1. The rice collected from mine-impacted regions, however, were found to be highly enriched in As, reaching concentrations of up to 624 ng g_1. Inorganic As (Asi) was the predominant species detected in all of the speciated grain, with Asi levels in some samples exceeding 300 ng g-1. The Asi concentration in polished and unpolished Chinese rice was successfully predicted from total As levels. The mean baseline concentrations for Asi in Chinese market rice based on this survey were estimated to be 96 ng g_1 while levels in mine-impacted areas were higher with ca. 50% of the rice in one region predicted to fail the national standard. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},
