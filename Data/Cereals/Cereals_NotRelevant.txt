   abstract = {A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified by non-contaminated oats, but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats. Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed. The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB), and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used to assess symptoms and quality of life, serological tests were performed, and results of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats were diagnosis after the year 2000, advice from a dietitian, detection by screening, and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.746), the prevalence of symptoms (22.9% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.931), positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.237), histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.773), malignancy (4.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.420), osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.489), or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.791). The oat consumers had better SF-36 physical role limitations and general health scores. Based on our results, the long-term consumption of oats in celiac disease patients is safe and may improve quality of life. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The subjects were residents of five sampling sites selected in Patiala city. Concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Sulfur dioxide (SO 2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and Particulate Matter (PM) of size less than 10 and 2.5μm (PM 10 and PM 2.5) were measured by using High Volume Sampler (HVS) and Cascade Anderson Impactor. Results show that rice crop residue burning increases the pollution level in the ambient air, and PFTs undergo a significant decrease in their respective values. No significant change was seen in SpO 2 level during rice crop residue burning. In 2008, an increase of 10μgm -3 in PM 2.5, PM 10, SPM and NO 2 was associated significantly with decrease in FVC in percentages predicted -1.541, -1.002, -1.178, -0.232%, respectively. The decrease in air quality due to open rice crop residue burning has sub acute effect on pulmonary functions of healthy subjects and that SO 2 and NO 2 have less adverse effects on pulmonary functions than with different size Particulate Matter. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Low productivity in agriculture due to damage cause by pests has led to the application of pesticides to control pest infestation. Residues of pesticides applied on crops are often found in the food which can cause chronic effect on the health of humans who consume such products. The aim of this study is to measure pesticides residues in maize and cowpea and compare the values with stablished safety limits. A total of 37 pesticides comprising 15 organochlorines, 13 organophosphorus and 9 pyrethroids pesticides were identified in maize and cowpea samples obtained from farms in Ejura. Analytical methods included solvent extraction of the pesticide residues and their subsequent quantification using gas chromatograph equipped with Electron Capture Detector and Pulse Flame Photometric Detector after clean-up on alumina/activated charcoal column. The results showed that the mean concentration of pesticides in maize ranged from 0.001 to 0.103mgkg-1 for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.019mgkg-1 for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.002-0.028mgkg-1 for pyrethroids pesticides. In cowpea the mean concentration ranged from 0.001 to 0.108mgkg-1 for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.015mgkg-1 for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.001-0.039mgkg-1 for pyrethroids pesticides. Maximum Residue Limits for β-HCH, β-endosulfan, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD were exceeded in both maize and cowpea samples. Health risk estimation revealed that residues of heptachlor, dieldrin, endrin, β-endosulfna, γ-chlordane and chlorfenvinphos found in maize exceeded the Acceptable Daily Intake. Similarly the levels of heptachlor and p,p'-DDD found in cowpea also exceeded the Acceptable Daily Intake. This suggests a great potential for chronic toxicity to consumers of these food items. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The QuEChERS method was used for extraction and clean-up of pesticide residues. Subsequent detection and quantification were done using GC with ECD and PFPD. Levels of p,p'-DDE, dieldrin, beta-endosulfan, beta-HCH, and gamma-HCH detected in the processed cereal-based complementary food were higher than their respective MAL. The mean estimated daily intakes of OCPs in infants were significantly higher than that of young children. Exposure levels of heptachlor and dieldrin were higher than their respective AM's. Their His recorded were greater than 1 indicating the possibility of adverse health effect on consumers. Hazard ratio for carcinogenic risk posed by beta-HCH, dieldrin, heptachlor, gamma-HCH and gamma-chlordane were greater than 1.

   abstract = {Background: Food contaminated with fungi and their toxins is a problem that threatens many developing countries. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia depends on the exported grain and legume seeds. Materials and methods: The study involved examination of 160 samples of rice and maize seeds collected from different locations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Heterogeneity in the 18s rRNA gene of toxigenic Alternaria sp. and Fusarium sp. was unraveled. The seeds were disinfected and cultured on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Yeast Extract Sucrose (YES) media and incubated at 25 °C/7 days. The isolated fungi were subjected to 18s rRNA gene sequencing. Five toxins were extracted from maize and rice grains infected with isolated fungi. Results: The isolated fungi were identified based on morphological and spores characters as Fusarium sp. and Alternaria sp. Molecular identification based on18s rDNA barcode' was performed due to its high degree of inter specific variability, conserved primer sites and multi-copy nature in the genome. Fusarium sp. produced the highest detected (2070 μg/kg) fumonisin especially in cereal production season 2011. The collected grain from Dammam recorded the highest percentage (5485.2 g/kg) of toxins. Conclusion: This work highlights that 50% of samples were found contaminated with toxins in various concentrations which impose a threat for public health and necessitate rapid identification methods for toxigenic fungi such as 18s rDNA sequencing. © 2018},

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of combining heat and irradiation treatments in controlling the fungal growth in maize grains. Surface disinfected maize grains were artificially contaminated with spores of Aspergillus flavus Link NRRL 5906, and then exposed to gamma radiation with doses of 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 kGy. The samples were additionally heat treated at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The heat and irradiation treatments showed a synergistic effect on controlling Aspergillus flavus growth. The heat treatment reduced the required radiation dose of about 0.5-1.0 kGy when 4.0 kGy or 5.0 kGy irradiation was used. The combined heat and irradiation treatment of moisture reduced the average CFU by 8 log cycles when 4 kGy or 5 kGy irradiation was used and by 7 log cycles when 3 kGy irradiation was used. The heat treatment of moisture alone reduced the average CFU by only by 0.8 log cycles. Combining irradiation with heat treatment to reduce the required radiation dose is very useful especially when there is a concern over biological side effects of irradiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The selectivity of the MIP was also checked by its application to wheat extracts. Then, after this feasibility study, two different formats of MIP. crushed monolith and micro-beads were evaluated and compared Therefore an optimization procedure was applied to the selective extraction from wheat using the MIP beads The whole procedure was validated by applying it to wheat extract spiked by OTA at different concentration levels and then to a certified contaminated wheat sample Recoveries close to 100% were obtained The high selectivity brought by the MIP was compared to the selectivity by an immunoaffinity cartridge for the clean-up of the same wheat sample The study of capacity of both showed a significant higher capacity of the MIP (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Obtaining representative test samples for antibody-based testing is challenging when analyzing whole grains for gluten. When whole grains are ground into flour for testing, confocal microscopy studies have shown that gluten tends to exist as aggregates within the starch background, making single-sample testing inaccurate and complicating the ability to arrive at an accurate average from multiple samples. In addition, whole-grain products present a unique risk to gluten free consumers, in that any contamination is localized to specific servings rather than being distributed across the product lot. This makes parts-per-million values less relevant for whole-grain products. Intact grains, seeds, beans, pulses, and legumes offer an alternative opportunity for gluten detection, in that contaminating gluten-containing grains (GCGs) are visible and identifiable to the trained eye or properly calibrated optical sorting equipment. The purpose of the current study was to determine a Gluten Free Certification Organization threshold level for the maximum number of GCGs within a kilogram of nongluten grains sold as specially processed gluten free product and to determine the feasibility of this threshold by evaluating visual examination data from two major oat processors. © 2018 AOAC International.

The rice farming protects the biodiversity of the region and maintains the ecosystem for the benefit of environment. Some rice varieties release biocidal allelochemicals which might affect major weeds, microbial and pathogenic diversity around rice plants, even soil characteristics. A large number of compounds such as phenolic acids, fatty acids, indoles and terpenes have been identified in rice root exudates and decomposing rice residues, as putative allelochemicals which can interact with surrounding environment. Since these allelopathic interactions may be positive, they can be used as effective contributor for sustainable and eco-friendly agro-production system. Genetic modification of crop plants to improve their allelopathic properties and enhancement of desirable traits has been suggested. Development of crops with enhanced allelopathic traits by genetic modification should be done cautiously, keeping in view of the ecological risk assessment (non-toxic and safe for humans and ecosystem, crop productivity, ratio of benefit and cost, etc.). © 2016 China National Rice Research Institute.},

A valid method based on spiked calibration curves and QuEChERS sample preparation was developed for determination of pesticides residue in rice by GC/MS. The analytical results of the proposed method were in good agreement with the proficiency test (FAPAS 0969). One-hundred-thirty-five rice samples were analyzed and 11 pesticide residues were found in 10.4% of the samples. Of which 5.2% were contaminated with unregulated pesticides. None of the samples, which were contaminated with regulated pesticides, had contamination higher than maximum residue limit. The mean estimated dose (ED) was calculated with respect of mean of contamination and mean daily consumption of rice. ED of the found pesticides is much lower than the related ADIs. © 2018 by School of Pharmacy Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.},

   abstract = {Data from silage maize variety trials of the years 1999-2010 in the Central German dry region were subjected to a secondary analysis using methods of mathematical statistics:With the phenological ripeness indicators (grain dry matter content/TM of the residual plant) the differences in the ripeness dynamics of grain to residual plant and their effects on the economy and ecology compared to the current ripeness system with use-specific ripeness numbers are documented. This dependence on all directions of use in the maize of the environments and varietal types taking into account of the different plasticity of maize varieties is been quantified. The achievement of physiological ripening of the grain is the interface of all usage directions and at the same time basis for the comparable, agro-eco-efficient level of maturity (63% TM) in conjunction with the silage ripeness index (SRI of 2.8) by eco-silage maize crops. The specific characteristics of the usage directions are low and with regard to efficiency, environmental and consumer protection discussed. With the phenological stage indicator (SRI) can both replaced the DM content of the whole plant as a parameter to the harvest date of silage and energy maize as the usage-specific ripeness numbers to the variety choice for silage and grain maize. A classification of the varieties according to ripeness groups would fully correspond to the environmental maize production. In the preparation of production (breeding, approval, testing and type of election), the SRI serves as selection and during inventory management through differential ripening control in compliance with the environmental and field production conditions as ripeness index. The wide ripeness ratio between grain and residual plant is the phenotypic expression of maize varieties as indicator for the agro-eco-efficiency and multifunctional guarantee better plant health, the resource efficiency, as well as basic product safety and sustainability of the process of maize silage. A precise fixing of harvest time point (HTP) is possible only with the SRI. The correct HTP is in principle maximum possible SRI. This HTP differently from the silage optimum can be according to the environments and the type of election. Ideally a maximum high SRI of 2. 9 and over to a high basic intake of ground feed when reaching for exclusive maize silage feeding ruminant more friendly, better structural efficiency and grain hardness for the bypass of starch in the small intestine. The variety and the harvest strategy are to focus their reasons of economy and ecology on a high proportion of stocks ripeness in the field of silage optimum (SRI > 2.6) reach. Standard for maximum efficiency of production process maize and its environmental and consumer protection in the field of view of social line is the reaching of the agro eco-efficient ripeness point (SRI of 2.8 at physiological ripeness of grain by 63%). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {The consistent appropriate selection of environment-stable varieties, the range of plant without ear up to maximal ripeness ratio of grain to residual plant are the cardinal question in maize cultivation respecting the ripeness, growing and environmental conditions. By permanent control of the ripening process in the pre-harvest period up to ripeness maximum possible ratio of grain to rest plant (real time of harvest) and its detection by the Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) as phenological performance, selection and stress indicator the environmental performance potential of all varieties can be exploited, in all years, as well as each location and in all directions of use. The plant without ear as a concrete expression of the reduction of biomass production caused by drought stress and the careless cultivation of unstable varieties provide the base inevitably for drastic, estimated losses with regard to quality, yield, as well as extensive risks in environmental, consumer and animal welfare. Ripe different maize with green, vital and active photosynthesis residual plant with 22 % dry matter is in the field of physiological ripeness of grain by 63 % up to the agro-eco-efficient ripeness point and the interface of all use directions. Silage and energy maize with the SRI of 2.8 and still green residual plant should be continued in the interest of the effectiveness of the high-performance feeding up to the maximum possible ripeness ratio. The establishment of the plant architecture in the form of high maize high of about 225 cm is better for improve the yield potential compared to compact. Such differences were indifferent and not pronounced at the quality indicators. By phenotyping of the production levels in maize, also the risks of all kinds are estimated preventable in addition to the appraisal of quality and yield. In addition an assessment of ripeness, growing and environmental conditions of the crop year can be on the other hand same range based on the SRI retroactively. Interfaces, as the agro-eco-efficient ripeness point, for the coupling of other crop models, a selection index for breeding objectives of all use directions (performance, resistance and food value) as an environmental variable and standard for trial basis have been created with this Dynamic Ripeness and Analysissystem (DRA). The efficiency of the entire production branch is also ecologically to justify itself according to maximize success in each direction of use maize.},

   pages = {155-168},
   abstract = {Bread is one of the bases of the Mediterranean diet, but as the society becomes wealthier, bread consumption decreases dramatically. Wheat and barley bread was part of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations, and maize was enthusiastically incorporated into the traditional European cuisine as soon as the Spaniards met this high yielding cereal in Central America. Indeed, maize was a solution to the famine crisis that devastated Europe and became one main provider of carbohydrates in the humid Spain, northern Portugal and throughout the Old World soon after the discovery of America. Whole grain is used for manufacturing bread and several derived recipes either with maize alone or in combination with other cereals, such as wheat, rye or rice, depending on the production of each particular region. Originally, maize used for bread came from tropical areas of Central America, where it had been selected by the natives for human consumption. Those first varieties were mainly white flint corn with a high content of proteins and fats and were adapted to temperate conditions. Besides carbohydrates, maize is a convenient source of minerals, vitamins and antioxidant compounds that can be worthwhile to exploit, given the high yield of maize compared to other cereals. Maize proteins are low in lysine and tryptophan, and the Native Americans used to combine maize with beans in order to get an equilibrated protein intake. There is wide variability within the maize germplasm for most of these quality parameters. From the perspective of health, two singular questions affect maize for human consumption: first, maize lacks gluten and, therefore, constitutes a key nutrient for people suffering from celiac disease; and second, we cannot neglect the problem of micotoxins, which are toxic substances produced by fungi. These toxins can reach levels that pose a threat for human health depending on growing and storing conditions. Therefore, this review focuses on three main issues of maize bread: germplasm and breeding, quality and food safety. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Alternaria species have the ability to produce a variety of secondary metabolite, which plays important roles in food safety. Argentina is the second largest exporter of fresh and processed food products to Europe, however, few studies on Alternaria mycotoxins and other bioactive secondary metabolites have been carried out on Argentinean cereals, fruit and vegetables. Knowing the full chemical potential and the distribution of Alternaria spp. on crops, it is necessary to establish a toxicological risk assessment for food products for human consumption. In the present study, 87 Alternaria strains from different substrates (tomato, wheat, blueberries and walnuts) were characterized according to morphology and metabolite production. Aggressive dereplication (accurate mass, isotopic patterns and lists of all described compounds from Alternaria) was used for high-throughput evaluation of the chemical potential. Four strains belonged to the Alternaria infectoria sp.-grp., 6 to the Alternaria arborescens sp.-grp., 6 showed a sporulation pattern similar to that of "M" according to Simmons, 1 to that of Alternaria vaccinii, and the remaining 70 constituted a diverse group belonging to morphological groups "G" and "H". The cluster analysis yielded 16 almost identical dendrograms and grouped the Alternaria strains into four clusters and 11 singletons and outlier groups. The chemical analysis showed that AOH and AME were the most common metabolites produced, followed by TEN, ALXs and TeA. The A. infectoria sp.-grp. had no metabolites in common with the rest of the strains. Several secondary metabolites isolated from large-spored Alternaria species or other fungal genera were detected, such as dehydrocurvularin, pyrenochaetic acid and alternarienonic acid. The strains isolated from tomato produced lower amounts of metabolites than strains from blueberries, walnut and wheat, although individual strains from tomato produced the highest amount of some metabolites. The A. infectoria sp.-grp. was unique to cereals, whereas strains classified as belonging to the A. arborescens sp.-grp or having sporulation pattern "M" were only isolated from tomatoes. Otherwise, no clear association between substrate and identity could be found. The analyses in the study show that at least 75% of the Argentinean strains are able to produce potential mycotoxins. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This method involved a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at four levels, and the recoveries ranged from 83.6 to 102.9%, whereas the maximum values of repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 14.3 and 15.7% following the performance criteria set by the European legislation. The method was then applied for the analysis of 21 cereal-derived products purchased on the Italian market, which were correctly packaged and labeled as intended for human consumption. The co-occurrence of more than one mycotoxin in the analyzed samples could represent a risk for consumers, and the described method could be a valid alternative for their simultaneous detection in the framework of official control.

The two instruments tested herein were the manual version of the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service single-kernel near-infrared (SKNIR) instrument and the automated QualySense QSorter Explorer high-speed sorter, both used in similar near-infrared spectral ranges. Three linear discriminate self-prediction models were developed: 1) oats versus groats + nonoats, 2) oats + groats versus nonoats, and 3) groats versus nonoats. For all three models, the SKNIR instrument showed high correct classification of oats or groats (94.5-100%), which was similar to results of the QSorter Explorer at 95.0-99.4%. The amount of nonoats that were misclassified as oats or groats was low for both instruments at 0-0.2% for the SKNIR instrument and 0.8-3.7% for the QSorter Explorer. Linear discriminate models from independent prediction and validation sets yielded classification accuracies of 91.6-99.3% (SKNIR) and 90.5-97.8% (QSorter Explorer). Small differences in classification accuracy were attributed to processing speeds between the two instruments: 3 kernels/s for the SKNIR instrument and 35 kernels/s for the QSorter Explorer. This indicated that both instruments are useful for quantifying grain sample compositions of oat and groat samples and that both could be useful tools for meeting consumer demand for gluten-free or low-gluten products. Discrimination between grains will help producers and manufacturers meet various regulatory requirements. Examples include requirements such as those from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Commission of European Communities, in which gluten-free oats or other products can only be labeled as nongluten if they contain gluten at less than 20 ppm, the established safe consumption limit for people with celiac disease. The QSorter Explorer is currently being used to meet these requirements.},

   abstract = {Gibberella and Fusarium Ear Rot and Fusarium Head Blight are major diseases affecting European cereals. These diseases are mainly caused by fungi of the Fusarium genus, primarily Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium verticillioides. These Fusarium species pose a serious threat to food safety because of their ability to produce a wide range of mycotoxins, including type B trichothecenes and fumonisins. Many factors such as environmental, agronomic or genetic ones may contribute to high levels of accumulation of mycotoxins in the grain and there is an urgent need to implement efficient and sustainable management strategies to reduce mycotoxin contamination. Actually, fungicides are not fully efficient to control the mycotoxin risk. In addition, because of harmful effects on human health and environment, their use should be seriously restricted in the near future. To durably solve the problem of mycotoxin accumulation, the breeding of tolerant genotypes is one of the most promising strategies for cereals. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant resistance to both Fusarium and mycotoxin contamination will shed light on plant-pathogen interactions and provide relevant information for improving breeding programs. Resistance to Fusarium depends on the plant ability in preventing initial infection and containing the development of the toxigenic fungi while resistance to mycotoxin contamination is also related to the capacity of plant tissues in reducing mycotoxin accumulation. This capacity can result from two mechanisms: metabolic transformation of the toxin into less toxic compounds and inhibition of toxin biosynthesis. This last mechanism involves host metabolites able to interfere with mycotoxin biosynthesis. This review aims at gathering the latest scientific advances that support the contribution of grain antioxidant secondary metabolites to the mechanisms of plant resistance to Fusarium and mycotoxin accumulation. © 2016 Atanasova-Penichon, Barreau and Richard-Forget.},

However, aflatoxin contamination is a threatening issue in these staples and its negative effects on human health, most especially infants and young children, are very alarming. Thus, this review sought to highlight the risk of aflatoxin contamination in cereals and legumes so as to reconsider their usage in complementary feeding. Factors such as temperature, relative humidity/moisture, soil properties, type and length of storage as well as nutrient composition of the food produce greatly influence fungal growth and aflatoxin production in cereals and legumes. Consumption of such contaminated food ingredients could expose many infants and young children to poor growth and development. Nonetheless, the toxin, though seemingly inevitable, can be minimized if not curbed completely through awareness creation/education, good agricultural practices and proper storage practices. Moreover, consumption of root and tuber crops such as sweetpotato, especially the orange-fleshed sweetpotato, can be a sustainable approach to reduce aflatoxin ingestion in children. Thus, to control the adverse effects of aflatoxin in infants and young children, cereal-legume blends could be substituted with root and tuber-based blends in complementary feeding. © 2017 The Authors},

   abstract = {During on-farm drying and storage of rice, weather conditions may not allow complete drying of rice in a timely manner leading to growth of molds, yeast, and bacteria in the grain mass. Under some stressful conditions of temperature, relative humidity and grain moisture content (MC), certain molds occurring on the grain multiply and may produce mycotoxins. Some mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, are very toxic and highly carcinogenic, and pose health hazards to consumers. Therefore, it is important to determine the initial levels of microorganisms and the factors that influence these populations on freshly-harvested rice so that effective drying and storage strategies can be implemented to avoid mycotoxin contamination. In this study, a survey was conducted to determine the effect of various factors including rice cultivar, growing geographic locations, and harvest time on the prevalence of microorganisms on rough rice. Specifically, the total (ground sample) and surface aerobic plate count (APC) and mold count on freshly-harvested, long-grain hybrid (XL723 and XL753), long-grain pureline (CL152 and Roy J) and medium-grain (Caffey and Jupiter) rice cultivars grown at four Arkansas locations (Stuttgart, Rohwer, Colt and Keiser) were studied. The average water activity and MC of all the rough rice samples at harvest were 0.914±0.008 and 22.26±3.02 (%, w.b.), respectively. The average total APCs on rice (total APCs) and APCs on the rice surface (surface APCs) were 7.21 and 6.29 log colony forming units per gram (log cfu/g), respectively. The average total mold counts on rice and the surface mold counts on rice surface were 5.53 and 5.05 log cfu/g, respectively. The APCs and mold counts significantly depended on the rice cultivars and harvest locations. Long-grain hybrid cultivars had the least mean total APC (7.1 log cfu/g) followed by medium-grain (7.2 log cfu/g) and long-grain pureline (7.2 log cfu/g) rice cultivars. The long-grain pureline cultivar CL152 had the greatest average APCs (7.31 log (cfu)/g). Long-grain hybrid rice cultivars had the least mean total mold count (5.2 log cfu/g) followed by long-grain pureline (5.4 log cfu/g) and medium-grain (5.6 log cfu/g) rice cultivars. The medium-grain cultivar (Caffey) had the greatest mean total mold count (5.6 log cfu/g). The geographic location where rice was grown had a significant effect on the level of microbial contamination on the rice kernels at harvest. As much as 1.5- and 3.2-fold total APC and mold count were observed in rice harvested at Rohwer compared to Keiser. Samples of rice harvested at Keiser tended to have the least microbial loads followed by those from Colt; samples from Stuttgart and Rohwer, the southernmost locations, had the greatest microbial loads. These findings could benefit the rice industry by helping to develop effective strategies for drying, storage and/or decontamination of rice, thereby helping to prevent mycotoxin development.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are considered unavoidable natural mycotoxins encountered in foods, animal feeds, and feed grains. In this study, we demonstrate the application of our recently developed real-time immunoquantitative PCR (RT iq-PCR) assay for sensitive detection and quantification of aflatoxins in poultry feed, two types of dairy feed (1 and 2), horse feed, whole kernel corn feed grains, and retail yellow ground corn meal. Upon testing methanol/water (60:40) extractions of the above samples using competitive direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, the aflatoxin content was found to be <20 mu g/kg. The RT iq-PCR assay exhibited high antigen hook effect in samples containing aflatoxin levels higher than the quantification limits (0.1-10 mu g/kg), addressed by comparing the quantification results of undiluted and diluted extracts. In testing the reliability of the immuno-PCR assay, samples were spiked with 200 mu g/kg of aflatoxin B-1, but the recovery of spiked aflatoxin was found to be poor. Considering the significance of determining trace levels of aflatoxins and their serious implications for animal and human health, the RT iq-PCR method described in this study can be useful for quantifying low natural aflatoxin levels in complex matrices of food or animal feed samples without the requirement of extra sample cleanup.},

   abstract = {Fusarium verticillioides is a very important genus from the aspects of plant disease, cereal production, and food safety. A major concern of this species is its mycotoxins, which are harmful to humans and animals ingesting Fusarium-contaminated food or feed products. The fungus exists as a symptomless intercellular endophyte in both field and sweet maize, but its role during the symptomless state of infection is ambiguous. Most strains produce the fumonisin in large quantities during the preharvest and postharvest periods of maize production, even during the symptomless state. The dual nature of F. verticillioides as both pathogen and a symptomless endophyte indicates a complex relationship with maize. Interactive biotic factors such as plant genetics, along with abiotic factors, may alter the required balanced relationships, resulting in a weakened plant and changing the relationship into a disease, during which mycotoxins are produced. Consequently, the development of appropriate control measures for the virulent state is expected to be difficult. Two biocontrol agents and approaches are also reviewed, along that offering some pre- and postharvest biological control measures designed to reduce maize contamination by F. verticillioides and the fumonisin mycotoxins.

However, little is known about the effect of lactic acid fermentation on fungal contamination in rice cakes. Here, we show that lactic acid fermentation in rice dough can greatly retard the growth of three fungal species when present in rice cakes, namely Cladosporium sp. YS1, Neurospora sp. YS3, and Penicillium crustosum YS2. The antifungal activity of the lactic acid bacteria against these fungi was much better than that of 0. 3% calcium propionate. We found that organic acids including lactic and acetic acid, which are byproducts of lactic fermentation or can be artificially added, were the main antifungal substances. We also found that some Leuconostoc citreum and Weissella confusa strains could be good starter species for rice dough fermentation. These results imply that these lactic acid bacteria can be applicable to improve the preservation of rice cakes. © 2012 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Methanol extracts from Ilpum (light-brown), Heugjinju (black), Jeogjinju (red), and WD-3 (purple) rice varieties were prepared and examined for antioxidant and anti-cancer activities. Bran and hull extracts from pigmented rice showed significantly (p<0.05) higher phenolic and flavonoidic compound contents, DPPH radical scavenging activities, and reducing powers than Ilpum extracts. Hull extracts showed greater cytotoxicity in human breast, melanoma, and oral cancer cells than bran extracts, where Heugjinju hull extract was the most potent. Hull extract-mediated cytotoxicity was due to apoptosis, based on the appearance of cellular shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and nuclear condensation. The caspase-dependent and mitochondrial-mediated pathways were associated with hull extract-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Rice residues can be used as sources of phenolic antioxidants and as anti-cancer agents for human health. © 2015, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {Aims of the research were: (1) to evaluate and compare 24 maize hybrids for Aspergillus flavus resistance and for aflatoxin accumulation under artificial inoculation in field experiments grown during 2005 and 2006; (2) to estimate the relationship of aflatoxin concentration with ear secondary traits. Primary ears were inoculated with a fresh spore suspension (mixture of five A. flavus isolates from Northern Italy), by spraying silks, as a modification of the non-wounding silk channel inoculation technique (SCIA); controls were both non-inoculated and sterile water-inoculated ears. Ear secondary traits, such as silk channel length measured at pollination and husk coverage at maturity, were recorded for each hybrid. The severity of ear A. flavus attack was estimated using rating scales based on the percentage of kernels with visible symptoms of infection. The aflatoxin concentration in the inoculated ears resulted, during both years, higher than in the controls; this indication confirmed that the A. flavus isolates used for the inoculum procedure were successful in accumulating mycotoxin in grains. Variability was found among the hybrids under study: aflatoxin accumulation, after artificial inoculation, ranged from 0.13 to 705.25 ng/g. The data herein presented supported the implication of two ear secondary traits in determining aflatoxin accumulation. Silk channel length recorded at pollination was negatively correlated (r = -0.54; P<0.05) with aflatoxin accumulation; on the contrary, a positive correlation (r = 0.48; P<0.05) between husk coverage rating at maturity and aflatoxin concentration suggested that a looser husk coverage is associated with higher aflatoxin accumulation. The correlation between the two mentioned ear-related traits was negative (r = -0.73; P<0.05); this indicated that hybrids showing a good coverage at pollination stage, are favoured in keeping the ear tip covered until maturity, reducing the risk of aflatoxin accumulation.},

   abstract = {Alpha-linolenic, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids were shown to cross-link hydrolyzed gluten in digested flour, thus reducing immunoreactivity of flour and bread. Residual immunoreactivity in cross-linked flour samples was determined with human coeliac immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 35–45% and 10–30%, respectively, for subtilisin and collagenase treatment. Analogous transglutaminase-cross-linked flour samples exhibited residual immunoreactivity at 34 and 15%. Chemical cross-linking reagents – polyethylenimine and diethanolamine – decreased it below 20%. Similar results were obtained when rabbit anti-QQQPP (Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro-Pro) IgG were used as detection antibodies. Flour samples underwent fermentation, thermal processing and simulated digestion. Residual immunoreactivity in bread made of flour cross-linked with fatty acids was determined with human IgG at 10–70% and 3–60%, respectively, for subtilisin and collagenase treatment. At the same time, transglutaminase cross-linking yielded residual immunoreactivity of bread at 10–20%. Rabbit antibodies did not indicate significant differences between samples of collagenase-treated bread, whether cross-linked with transglutaminase or fatty acids. Practical Applications: Given the popularity of cereal-based products in our diet, gluten intolerance is a significant issue. The antigenicity of flour proteins can, to a great extent, be neutralized through hydrolysis and cross-linking with polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. Antigenic amino acid structures are bound deep into the complex surface of the cross-linked protein and are rendered unrecognizable to the consumer's immune system. Cross-linked proteins in flour and bread provoke milder allergy symptoms, allowing dietary restrictions to be reduced. These natural reagents could potentially be a valuable tool in efforts to produce safer bakery products. We propose that they could be used in combination with other known cross-linkers to improve the overall antigenic effect of food processing. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid for plants and animals. Large amounts of As have been released in arable soils through anthropogenic activities, use of contaminated irrigation water, and mining among others. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most consumed cereals worldwide; it is an important route of exposure for As. The objective of this review was to explain possible mechanisms involved in As absorption that contaminate rice plant through the soil and water, and to mention studies that have been conducted to minimize the risk of human exposure. The root is able to absorb and accumulate large amounts of As, but only small amounts are translocated to the grain and tillers. Arsenic concentrations in rice tissues decrease from the root to the grain. Information about As translocation in rice is sparse and research is directed toward studying the molecular mechanism of absorption and accumulation in the grain because it has not yet been explained. Some rice varieties have been developed that are resistant to high soil As concentrations and are not able to translocate the metalloid toward the root. Many studies suggest that not all ingested inorganic As accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract is absorbed into the bloodstream and produces toxicity. It is therefore recommended that As bioavailability be evaluated in imported or domestic Chilean rice to more precisely estimate human health risk. © 2016, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

   abstract = {Climate change has been reported as a driver for emerging food and feed safety issues worldwide and its expected impact on the presence of mycotoxins in food and feed is of great concern. Aflatoxins have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins; hence, the maximal concentration in agricultural food and feed products and their commodities is regulated worldwide. The possible change in patterns of aflatoxin occurrence in crops due to climate change is a matter of concern that may require anticipatory actions. The aim of this study was to predict aflatoxin contamination in maize and wheat crops, within the next 100 years, under a +2 degrees C and +5 degrees C climate change scenario, applying a modelling approach. Europe was virtually covered by a net, 50 x 50 km grids, identifying 2254 meshes with a central point each. Climate data were generated for each point, linked to predictive models and predictions were run consequently. Aflatoxin B-1 is predicted to become a food safety issue in maize in Europe, especially in the +2 degrees C scenario, the most probable scenario of climate change expected for the next years. These results represent a supporting tool to reinforce aflatoxin management and to prevent human and animal exposure.},

In 2005, limit values were issued by the EU commission to avoid health risks by mycotoxins, both for humans and animals. This increased the need to develop tools for early detection of infections. Occurrence of Fusarium-caused head blight disease can be detected by spectral analysis (400-1000. nm) before harvest. With this information, farmers could recognize Fusarium contaminations. They could, therefore, harvest the grains separately and supply it to other utilizations, if applicable. In the present study, wheat plants were analyzed using a hyper-spectral imaging system under laboratory conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate spectra of diseased and healthy ear tissues in the wavelength ranges of 500-533. nm, 560-675. nm, 682-733. nm and 927-931. nm, respectively. Head blight could be successfully recognized during the development stages (BBCH-stages) 71-85. However, the best time for disease determination was at the beginning of medium milk stage (BBCH 75). Just after start of flowering (BBCH 65) and, again, in the fully ripe stage (BBCH 89), distinction by spectral analysis is impossible. With the imaging analysis method 'Spectral Angle Mapper' (SAM) the degree of disease was correctly classified (87%) considering an error of visual rating of 10%. However, SAM is time-consuming. It involves both the analysis of all spectral bands and the setup of reference spectra for classification. The application of specific spectral sub-ranges is a very promising alternative. The derived head blight index (HBI), which uses spectral differences in the ranges of 665-675. nm and 550-560. nm, can be a suitable outdoor classification method for the recognition of head blight. In these experiments, mean hit rates were 67% during the whole study period (BBCH 65-89). However, if only the optimal classification time is considered, the accuracy of detection can be largely increased. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Original clay and pillared clays were characterized in terms of X-ray powder diffraction analysis and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The maximum amounts of adsorption of ZEN by K10, Al-K10, and Fe-K10 at 25°C and pH 7 were 0.202, 1.305, and 1.028 mg/g and 0.264, 0.096, and 0.255 mg/g, calculated from Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, respectively. The adsorption of ZEN was also studied as a function of adsorbent amount (1 to 30 g), ZEN concentration (2 to 20 mg/liter), pH of solution (pH 4 to 10), and contact time. Pillared clays could be an excellent alternative for removing ZEN in contaminated food samples and are potentially low-cost adsorbents with a promising future as an alternative to more costly materials.

   abstract = {Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by fungi such as Penicillium verrucosum and Aspergillium spp. and has been found to have a variety of potentially deadly toxic effects. The favoured substrate for fungal growth and OTA production appears to be cereals and flour-based products, including bread. Due to the dietary relevance of bread for the Portuguese population, it is imperative that its OTA content remains well within safe quantities. As such, bread samples collected from commercial surfaces across the Algarve region and from the city of Braganca during the winter of 2007 were tested for OTA through extraction with immunoaffinity columns and quantification by liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection. Although OTA content was found to be above the limit of quantification in approximately 60% and 50% of the analysed samples from Algarve and Braganca, respectively, all samples were found to be compliant with European Commission. OTA content reached maximums of 0.49 ng/g in Algarve and 0.43 ng/g in Braganca, and was thus below the maximum limit established by European legislation for bread of 3 ng/g. The results of the present study put the estimated daily intake of OTA from bread at approximately 0.26 ng/kg bw/day in Algarve and 0.38 ng/kg bw/day in Braganca, circa 1.5% and 2.0% of the TDI established by either the EFSA or the FAO/WHO, or over 4.5% and 6.5% if we consider the FAO/WHO advised bread consumption of 250 g/day. These results seem to suggest that, in these two Portuguese regions, OTA contamination is well under control and unlikely to represent a threat to consumer health. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {To determine whether plant sequences, including transgenic sequences, are present in animal blood, we tested blood samples from Holstein cows fed with either Bt176 genetically modified corn or conventional corn. We used previously described sensitive real-time PCR assays targeting transgenic sequences (35S promoter and Bt176 specific junction sequence), a monocopy maize-specific sequence (ADH promoter), and two multicopy sequences from plant nucleus (26S rRNA gene) and chloroplast (psaB gene). The presence of Cry1 A(b) protein in bovine blood samples was also tested using a sandwich ELISA kit. Our study shows the ability of plant nuclear and/or chloroplast DNA fragments to enter bovine blood circulation. However, maize nuclear DNA, both mono- and multicopy sequences, was less detected than chloroplast DNA, probably because the higher number of chloroplast copies and also possibly because nuclear DNA might be less protected by the nuclear membrane. Despite our data confirm the ability of small (ca.150 bp) plant DNA fragments to cross the intestinal barrier, we were unable to demonstrate clearly the presence of transgenic DNA or proteins in bovine blood. No sample tested positive with the two real-time PCR assays targeting transgenic sequences (35S promoter and Bt176 specific junction sequence). Only faint punctual positive results occurred randomly and were probably due to postsample collection or laboratory contamination or can be considered as artifact as they have never been confirmed. Our data highlight the difficulties to detect transgenic sequences in blood of dairy cows fed genetically modified corn (Bt176) silage. Those results show that in order to meet the consumers' demand of animals fed with GM products there is currently no cost-effective analytical procedure to replace documentary traceability. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Intensification of rice-based cropping systems in Asia has substantially increased production of food and associated crop residues. The interval between crops in these systems is often brief, making it attractive for farmers to burn residues in the field to hasten and facilitate tillage for the next crop. Open-air burning causes serious air quality problems affecting human health and safety, and it has been banned by many Asian governments. In this chapter, we evaluate for rice-based cropping systems existing and emerging in-field alternatives to burning residues based on criteria of productivity, profitability, environmental impact, and sustainability. In intensive rice monocropping systems, residue is typically managed under conditions of soil flooding and anaerobic decomposition during the rice crop. In systems, where rice is rotated with an upland (non-flooded) crop, there are two major categories: residue of upland crop managed during flooded rice and rice residue managed during the upland crop. One option during the flooded rice crop is incorporation of residues from the previous rice or upland crop into the soil. Many studies have examined incorporation of crop residue during land preparation for flooded rice. In the vast majority of cases there was no significant increase in yield or profit. Residue decomposition in anaerobic flooded soil substantially increases methane (CH4) emission relative to residue removal. Surface retention of residue during rice cropping is challenging to implement because residue must be removed from the field during conventional tillage with soil flooding (i.e., puddling) and then returned. Alternatively, rice must be established without the traditional puddling that has helped sustain its productivity. Mulch is a good option for rice residue management during the upland crop, especially with reduced and no tillage. Mulch can increase yield, water use efficiency, and profitability, while decreasing weed pressure. It can slightly increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emission compared with residue incorporation or removal, but N fertilization and water management are typically more important factors controlling N2O emission than residue management. Long-term studies of residue removal have indicated that removing residue from continuous rice systems with near continuous soil flooding does not adversely affect soil organic matter (SOM). The use of crop residue as a mulch with reduced or no tillage for upland crops should be promoted in rice-based cropping systems. On the contrary, residues from the crop preceding rice on puddled and flooded soil can be considered for removal for off-field uses. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Today, wheat is grown on more land area than any other commercial crop and continues to be the most important food grain source for humans. Agricultural waste was considered as an irrational behaviour of agricultural man power, i.e., producers, processors and consumers. Due to the role of reducing wheat waste in increasing production of wheat, Iran's Ministry of Agriculture commenced a program to reduce the waste and increase production of wheat and hired university graduated students in field of agriculture to work as advisors to train farmers the methods to increase production and reduce wastes in the Wheat Self Sufficiency Plan (WSP). The major purpose of this study was investigating of the role's farm advisors in reducing wastes in wheat production in Qazvin Province. The population for the study was 112 advisors in Qazvin Province and data collected by using a questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using statistical methods in SPSS. The results of the study showed there was a meaningful and positive relation between farm advisors' role in reducing wastes in wheat production as dependent variable and number of farm advisors' contacts with extension experts in Ministry of Agriculture in cultivation, rate of attending of farm advisors in educational courses on reducing wastes, adaptability of farm advisors' educational courses on reducing wastes with their needs, applying farm advisors' advices by farmers to reduce waste in plantation period, awareness of farm advisors about methods of reducing wastes in plantation period, using educational tools by farm advisors in farmers' education on reducing wheat wastes as independent variables.},

In order to identify the MRLs of potential concern that require a more detailed assessment, EFSA performed a preliminary risk assessment, identifying a risk for consumers for 12 commodities. Measures for reduction of the consumer exposure were assessed by EFSA and should be considered by risk managers. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, ADAMA Makhteshim Ltd submitted two requests to modify the existing MRL for acetamiprid in table olives, olives for oil production, barley and oats. The data submitted in support of the requests were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under assessment. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the short-term and long-term intake of residues resulting from the use of acetamiprid according to the intended agricultural practices on table olives, olives for oil production, barley and oats is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.

   abstract = {In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the evaluating Member State (EMS) Greece received an application from Dow AgroSciences to set an import tolerance for the active substance 2,4-D in genetically modified (GM) maize imported from Canada and the USA. The modification confers tolerance to the herbicide 2,4-D. Greece drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the data submitted are sufficient to conclude that a change of the existing maximum residue level (MRL) set at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.05 mg/kg in maize is not required. Analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of 2,4-D in cereals and no risk for consumers was identified for the notified use on GM maize expressing the aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase 1 (AAD-1) protein imported from Canada and the USA.

   abstract = {In November 2001, Nature published a letter in which University of California Berkeley's biologists claimed to have found evidence of genetically modified (GM) DNA in regional varieties of maize in Oaxaca, even though the Mexican government had banned transgenic corn agriculture in 1998. While urban protesters marched against the genetic contamination' of Mexican corn by US-based agricultural biotech firms, rural indigenous communities needed a framework for understanding concepts such as GM before they could take action. This article analyzes how the indigenous organization, the Zapatistas, mobilized a program to address this novel entity. Their anti-GM project entailed educating local farmers about genetics, importing genetic testing kits, seed-banking landrace corn and sending seeds to solidarity growers' around the world. This article explores material-semiotic translations to explain one of the central aspects of this project, the definition and circulation of Zapatista corn - an entity defined not only through cultural geography, but also technological means. Through its circulation, Zapatista corn serves to perform a biocultural engagement with Zapatista's political project of resistance to neoliberalism. While much has been written about both regulatory policy and consumer activism against GM in the Global North, Zapatista corn also provides a case study in indigenous, anti-GM activism founded on biocultural innovation and the creation of alternative networks for circulating corn.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxin contamination caused by Aspergillus flavus infection of corn is a significant and chronic threat to corn being used as food or feed. Contamination of crops at levels of 20 ng g-1 or higher (as regulated by the USFDA) by this toxin and potent carcinogen makes the crop unsalable, resulting in a significant economic burden on the producer. This review focuses on elimination of this contamination in corn which is a major US crop and the basis of many products. Corn is also "nature's example" of a crop containing heritable resistance to aflatoxin contamination, thereby serving as a model for achieving resistance to aflatoxin contamination in other crops as well. This crop is the largest production grain crop worldwide, providing food for billions of people and livestock and critical feedstock for production of biofuels. In 2011, the economic value of the US corn crop was US$76 billion, with US growers producing an estimated 12 billion bushels, more than one-third of the world's supply. Thus, the economics and significance of corn as a food crop and the threat to food safety due to aflatoxin contamination of this major food crop have prompted the many research efforts in many parts of the world to identify resistance in corn to aflatoxin contamination. Plant breeding and varietal selection has been used as a tool to develop varieties resistance to disease. This methodology has been employed in defining a few corn lines that show resistance to A. flavus invasion; however, no commercial lines have been marketed. With the new tools of proteomics and genomics, identification of resistance mechanisms, and rapid resistance marker selection methodologies, there is an increasing possibility of finding significant resistance in corn, and in understanding the mechanism of this resistance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

These polysaccharides are beneficial constituents of human diets, where they can reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, type II diabetes, obesity and colorectal cancer. The biosynthesis of cell wall (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans in the Poaceae is mediated, in part at least, by the cellulose synthase-like CslF family of genes. Over-expression of the barley CslF6 gene under the control of an endosperm-specific oat globulin promoter results in increases of more than 80% in (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan content in grain of transgenic barley. Analyses of (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan fine structure indicate that individual CslF enzymes might direct the synthesis of (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans with different structures. When expression of the CslF6 transgene is driven by the Pro35S promoter, the transgenic lines have up to sixfold higher levels of (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan in leaves, but similar levels as controls in the grain. Some transgenic lines of Pro35S:CslF4 also show increased levels of (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans in grain, but not in leaves. Thus, the effects of CslF genes on (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan levels are dependent not only on the promoter used, but also on the specific member of the CslF gene family that is inserted into the transgenic barley lines. Altering (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan levels in grain and vegetative tissues will have potential applications in human health, where (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans contribute to dietary fibre, and in tailoring the composition of biomass cell walls for the production of bioethanol from cereal crop residues and grasses.},

   abstract = {Plant cell walls consist predominantly of polysaccharides and lignin. There has been a surge of research activity in plant cell wall biology in recent years, in two key areas. Firstly, in the area of human health it is now recognized that cell wall polysaccharides are key components of dietary fiber, which carries significant health benefits. Secondly, plant cell walls are major constituents of lignocellulosic residues that are being developed as renewable sources of liquid transport biofuels. In both areas, the cell walls of the Poaceae, which include the cereals and grasses, are particularly important. The non-cellulosic wall polysaccharides of the Poaceae differ in comparison with those of other vascular plants, insofar as they contain relatively high levels of heteroxylans as "core" polysaccharide constituents and relatively smaller amounts of heteromannans, pectic polysaccharides, and xyloglucans. Certain grasses and cereals walls also contain (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans, which are not widely distributed outside the Poaceae. Although some genes involved in cellulose, heteroxylan, and (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis have been identified, mechanisms that control expression of the genes are not well defined. Here we review current knowledge of cell wall biology in plants and highlight emerging technologies that are providing new and exciting insights into the most challenging questions related to the synthesis, re-modeling and degradation of wall polysaccharides. © 2012 Burton and Fincher.},

Samples were investigated for total aflatoxin (AF), aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), and ochratoxin A (OTA) levels. The results show that AF levels in 65(65.0%), AFB(1), levels in 35(35.0%), and OTA levels in 38 (38.0%) of 100 samples were higher than the detection limits. AF and AFB(1), levels in all samples were at tolerable limits. OTA levels in 3 samples have been found higher than the legal limits. The highest OTA level in the samples was found in winter season due to climatic conditions, especially relative humidity. Additionally, rice is mainly contaminated by AF, AFB(1), and OTA. In Turkey, contamination in rice could be a relatively critical point for human health. Therefore, it is necessary to have an appropriate method for cereal preservation during distribution to consumers and markets.},

   abstract = {According to the problems of seeds and sprouts decay and food safety caused by microbial contamination in the production of buckwheat sprouts, weakly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) was applied in seed soaking and spaying in sprouts production. The effects of SAEW treatments on the properties of seeds germination, inhibition of microorganism and the quality of seed sprouts were determined. The results indicated that it was appropriate for buckwheat seeds to be soaked by SAEW with available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 40 mg/L and pH value of 5.0. Spraying SAEW with an ACC of 50 mg/L for buckwheat sprouts could reduce the population of bacteria and fungus on the sprouts and increase the height of buckwheat sprouts, reducing sugar content and rutin content, while had no negative effect on yield and dry weight of buckwheat sprouts.},

   abstract = {Wheat is the most important cereal consumed by the Argentine population. In previous studies performed in durum and common wheat grains in this country it has been observed fumonisin contamination as well as high incidence of Fusariwn proliferatwn. Fumonisins are toxic fungal metabolites, and consumption of fumonisin-contaminated maize has been epidemiologically associated with oesophageal cancer and neural tube defects in some human populations. Using irradiated wheat-grains, the effects of abiotic factors, temperature (15, 25, and 30 degrees C) and water activity (a(w); 0.995, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94, 0.92, and 0.88), on mycelial growth and fumonisin biosynthesis were compared for three F. proliferation strains isolated from wheat grains in Argentina. Although all isolates showed similar profiles of growth, the fumonisin production profiles were slightly different. Maximum growth rates were obtained at the highest aw (0.995) and 25 degrees C, with growth decreasing as the aw of the medium was reduced. Maximum amounts of total fumonisins (FB1, FB2 and FB3) were produced at 0.995 aw and 15 degrees C for 2 strains, and at 25 degrees C and 0.995 aw for the third one. Fumonisins concentrations varied considerably depending on the aw and temperature interactions assayed. Studied strains showed different fumonisin production profiles. Two-dimensional profiles of aw by temperature interactions were developed from these data to identify areas where conditions indicate a significant risk of fumonisins accumulation on wheat. As a result, temperature and aw conditions that resulted in fumonisins production are those found during wheat grain development (especially milk and dough stages) in the field. This is the first study made using irradiated wheat grains and provides useful baseline data on conditions representing a low or a high risk for fumonisins contamination of wheat grains which is of concern because this cereal is destined mainly for human consumption.},

This pilot study explored the biodiversity index between treated and untreated pesticide in rice cultivation. A field experimental study was performed in the wet season. A sweep net sampling method was used to collect insects from two rice fields, untreated and treated with pesticide in recommended rate according to the standard manual for testing insecticides on rice fields developed by the International Rice Research Institute. The species richness index (Esn) was computed by EcoSim - A null model software for ecology. Mean difference (MD) between groups with their 95% confident interval was estimated based on linear regression model. The results showed that the proportion of herbivores was similar to beneficial insects. Hence, the beneficial insects could control pests in rice fields and the application of pesticide might not be needed. Next, there were less unsafe handing system and practices of physical health for farmers, less contamination in food chain and less impact to biodiversity as well as less production loss and food security which effects to tension and mental health problems for farmers at finally. However, it was found that pesticides were highly toxic to natural enemies such as spiders and hymenopteran parasitoids, thus, disorganized predator-prey relationships. Moreover, the above-ground arthropod diversity in the rice field with untreated pesticide was significantly of higher degree than in the rice field with treated pesticide.},

They decrease type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer. ANSES recommends an increase in the consumption of whole cereals which is very low in France; other countries have a recommendation such as 90 g or three servings of whole grains per day. At the same time, ANSES recommends a dietary fibre intake of 30 g per day that cannot be achieved without the consumption of whole grain products. Depending on how they are grown, it can be assumed that whole grains contain more contaminants (including pesticides and mycotoxins) than refined cereal products. The presence of these contaminants is strictly controlled and the levels reached in the foods analyzed do not exceed the Toxicological Reference Values for a vast majority of consumers. Most epidemiological studies demonstrate a positive benefit/risk ratio that confirms the value of consuming whole grains for health. © 2017 Société française de nutrition},

   abstract = {Rice and wheat are the staple foods for almost the entire Asian population and therefore they occupy a premium position among all food commodities. The era of the Green Revolution started during the early 1970s with wheat and rice and since then the rice-wheat cropping system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains has played a significant role in the food security of the region. However, recent years have witnessed a significant slowdown in the yield growth rate of this system and the sustainability of this important cropping system is at risk due to second-generation technology problems and mounting pressure on natural resources. Traditional cultivars and conventional agronomic practices are no longer able to even maintain the gains in productivity achieved during the past few decades. Demand for food is increasing with the increasing population and purchasing power of consumers. The rice-wheat cropping system is labor-, water-, and energy-intensive and it becomes less profitable as these resources become increasingly scarce and the problem is aggravated with deterioration of soil health, the emergence of new weeds, and emerging challenges of climate change. Therefore, a paradigm shift is required for enhancing the system's productivity and sustainability. Resource-conserving technologies involving zero- or minimum-tillage in wheat, dry direct seeding in rice, improved water- and nutrient-use efficiency, innovations in residue management to avoid straw burning, and crop diversification should assist in achieving sustainable productivity and allow farmers to reduce inputs, maximize yields, increase profitability, conserve the natural resource base, and reduce risk due to both environmental and economic factors. A number of technological innovation and diversification options have been suggested to overcome the system's sustainability problems but some of them have not been fully embraced by the farmers as these are expensive, knowledge-intensive, or do not fit into the system and have resulted in some other unforeseen problems. Different concerns and possible strategies needed to sustain the rice-wheat cropping system are discussed in this review on the basis of existing evidence and future challenges.},

FAO's latest forecast for world cereal production in 2011 stands at nearly 2313 million tonnes. Total EU-27 grain production forecast was 283 and 272 million tonnes for 2011 and 2012, respectively. Cereal contamination has an important impact on human and animal health. The European Union has established the most comprehensive regulations for food and cereal safety to facilitate world trade and protect consumer health. This paper reviews the existing legislation associated with cereal safety, with a focus on mycotoxin contamination. Regulations and Directives were classified into the following topics: general food legislative framework, official controls (sampling and analysis), maximum levels for contaminants, prevention and reduction. To give the reader a rapid first approach to the topic of his interest, a synoptical presentation of all laws related to the above-mentioned topics is given, and the main points of each law, cited in conjunction with its effect on previous laws (repeal, modification, amendments, replacement, related acts), are reported in tables. Moreover, data regarding the worldwide occurrence of mycotoxins in cereals were reported. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Consequently, Cd can not only affect the quality and yield of crops, but also cause a great threat to human health. In this study, the plant height and root length of maize 'Nongda108' in the hydroponic solution containing titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) supplied with Cd were measured. The changes in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), plant heights, root lengths and apical staining were detected to study the effects and the mechanism of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) on the alleviation of cadmium stress on maize seedlings. The results show that plant heights, root lengths and Fv/Fm were significantly improved, whereas the damage of maize root tip was significantly decreased using the TiO2-NPs pretreatment, compared to Cd stress. Furthermore, Cd stress can significantly induce the activity of SOD in leaves, but the magnitude of changes of SOD is decreased in the TiO2-NPs pretreated sample. The Cd content measured at various treatments indicated that the Cd absorption in roots was decreased under TiO2+Cd and ZnO+Cd treatments, but the Cd migration to leaves did not reduce by TiO2+Cd or ZnO+Cd treatmen, whereas the Cd content in leaves was increased by ZnO+Cd treatment, which may exacerbate the Cd transfer from roots to leaves. These results suggest that TiO2-NPs could reduce the biological toxicity of Cd, thus alleviate the inhibitory effect of Cd on maize. ï¿½ 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

In this recent in-market survey, a third-party laboratory tested 166 servings of oatmeal manufactured with oats produced under a "Purity Protocol." Results indicated gluten at noncompliant levels in five servings (spanning 20.4-229 ppm). This equates to a noncompliance rate of 1 in 33 servings. This new finding is comparable to a noncompliant rate of 1 in 57 servings uncovered by our previous in-market survey, where the gluten-free (GF) oatmeal was manufactured with oats produced by mechanical/optical cleaning. These new findings, substantiated by the previous ones, show that GF oats not managed for gluten compliance at the serving level may introduce an intermittent bolus of gluten to consumers with celiac disease. © 2017 The Authors.},

In this study, a rapid and sensitive immunoassay system for commonly encountered mycotoxins was established based on microfluidics and protein microarrays. Four mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, and zearalenone) can be automatically detected in a custom-made microdevice within 30 min under the assistance of a prototype of the instrument with a fluid control system and an imaging system. Once the microdevices are fabricated, they are small-sized and user-friendly. Standard curves for each of the studied mycotoxins were generated with a good logistic correlation (R2 &gt; 0.98). Working ranges from 0.1 to 20 ng/ml were employed in the immunoassay being the limit of detection achieved between 0.03 and 1.24 ng/ml. These values were calculated when the four mycotoxins were present in samples at the same time. Samples of spiked water and field corn were tested to assess the performance of our microfluidic-based detection technique for the mycotoxins. Recovery rates of mycotoxins from spiked water and corn samples were accessed and the results ranged from 80% to 110%, where the intra-assay coefficients of variation were under 15%. In summary, the system can realize rapid and reliable detection of multiple contaminants in actual samples automatically. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Contamination of maize grain with mycotoxins including aflatoxin and fumonisin poses a threat to human health and livestock. The objectives of this study were to determine the current status of incidence of ear rot causing fungi, which are associated with mycotoxin contamination, in southern African maize hybrids, and to check whether or not mycotoxin resistance genes can be stacked in a single product. The 327 hybrids were evaluated under natural conditions in replicated trials over two seasons at Cedara Research Station, which is hot spot site for ear rot diseases. Concurrently, aflatoxin and fumonisin resistant tropical maize inbred lines were crossed with South African adapted inbred lines. The resultant 72 single crosses were evaluated for fumonisin contamination, while 44 three-way crosses and their progenies (146 S2:3 families) were evaluated for both aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination under artificial inoculation. The Fusarium verticillioides was the most prevalent ear rot causing fungus, followed by Stenocarpella maydis, F. graminearum and Aspergillus flavus. The late maturing hybrids were more susceptible to ear rots contamination than their earlier counterparts. Stacking of mycotoxin contamination resistance genes was successful because five experimental single cross hybrids consistently accumulated low fumonisin levels (&lt;4 ppm), both in the greenhouse and field trials. Three 3-way crosses displayed low contamination levels for both aflatoxins (&lt;5 ppb) and fumonisins. Four S2:3 families accumulated low levels of both aflatoxins and fumonisins below the legal limits of 5 ppb and 4 ppm, respectively. Therefore significant progress can be realised in breeding mycotoxin resistant maize hybrids. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to bumble bee declines in North America and Europe. This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from “conventional” seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or “organic” seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1–0.8 ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96 ± 15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127 ± 17 workers per hive). The results suggest that exposure during pollen shed to corn grown from neonicotinoid-treated shed poses low risk to B. impatiens. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Consumers, especially those with allergies and/or intolerances, should have confidence in two critical areas of food safety: foods should be correctly labelled and free from contamination. To this end, global proteomic analysis employing LC-MS/MS of gluten-enriched extracts derived from 12 barley cultivars was undertaken, providing a foundation for the development of MS-based quantitative methodologies that would enable the detection of barley contamination in foods. Subsequently, a number of candidate barley-specific peptide markers were evaluated by multiple-reaction monitoring MS. From an initial panel of 26, 9 peptide markers were unique to barley, yet present in a wide range of barley varieties. The analytical method was then used to examine a range of breakfast cereals and was able to detect barley in a barley-based breakfast cereal and a muesli, but additionally allowed detection of contamination of cereals that were comprised of ancient grains and in commercially-sourced flours, including amaranth, chia, buckwheat, millet, rice, corn, oats, rye, spelt and green wheat (0.01–0.08%). LC-MS/MS provides an alternative to ELISA approaches to monitor food safety and the identification of robust and sensitive cereal-specific peptide markers is the first step toward the adoption of this technology. Significance Coeliac disease is a serious health issue affecting up to 70 million people globally for which there is no cure. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Contamination of foods can occur at many stages of food production from farm to fork. As such, accurate quantification and identification of the source (i.e. cereal) and type (e.g. gluten) of contamination is critical to the health and well-being of a subset of the population, including those affected by coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. © 2016},

   abstract = {Enniatins (ENs) are secondary fungal metabolites with hexadepsipeptidic chemical structure and they possess a number of potent biological activities that can contaminate several kind of food and foodstuffs increasing the exposure risk for consumers. ENs are produced by several Fusariun strains including Fusarium subglutinans, Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium tricinctum. Production of a mixture of ENs was performed by culturing F. tricinctum ITEM 9496 on white corn as substrate. The solid culture components were dried and subsequently extracted with water/methanol (50/50 v/v, 0.5% NaCl), homogenised, filtered, extracted by ethyl acetate and analysed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD). The crude extract was first separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and then further purified by liquid chromatography (LC), resulting in six compounds with a purity higher than 95% as calculated by H-1 NMR, and with a yield of 30-300 mg per compound. The chemical structures of the ENs were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The biological activity of the resulting ENs was determined using a mitochondrial respiration test. We discovered that all the ENs studied induced an increase in the mitochondrial respiration resulting in uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation. This effect was most likely due to flux of K+ ions into the mitochondrial matrix. The order of potency of the ENs derivatives was: A(1) > B-1 > B > A > B-4 > J(1). These results suggest a correlation between the chemical structures and bioactivity and confirm the severe risks for human associated with consumption of enniatins. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: Cows' milk allergy (CMA) is the most common cause of food allergy in infancy. The only proven treatment is the complete elimination of cows' milk proteins (CMPs) from the diet by means of hypoallergenic formulas. Soybean-based formulae are widely used although intolerance to soy has been reported to occur in 15-40% of infants with CMA. Objective: The aim of this work was to analyse the in vitro reactivity of the soybean cultivar Raiden, which naturally lacks glycinin A4A5B3, to evaluate whether this genotype could be a safe CMP substitute for CMA patients. Methods: The reactivity of conventional soybean (CS) and Raiden soybean (RS) genotypes and also recombinant glycinin A4A5B3 and αβ-conglycinin with casein-specific monoclonal antibodies and CMP-specific polyclonal serum was evaluated by immunoblotting and ELISA. A sequential competitive ELISA with the polyclonal antiserum and different soluble inhibitors was performed. In addition, an indirect ELISA with sera of atopic children with CMA was carried out to analyse the IgE-binding capacity of the different soybean components. Results: We have shown that CS contains four components that cross-react with CMP, while RS has only one. The remaining cross-reactive component in RS was identified as α-subunit β-conglycinin. By means of inhibitory ELISA, we demonstrated that CS, RS and the α-subunit β-conglycinin extracts inhibited the binding of CMP-specific antibodies to the CMP-coated solid phase. Finally, we showed that CS, RS and the recombinant proteins were recognized by human CMP-specific IgE antibodies. Conclusion: This work shows that although Raiden has fewer cross-reactive components than conventional soybean, it still has a residual cross-reactive component: the α-subunit β-conglycinin. This reactivity might make this genotype unsuitable to treat CMA and also explains adverse reactions to soybean in CMA infants. © 2008 The Authors.},

There were 25 varieties in 2012 and 59 in 2013, with eleven present in both trials. The trials were split-plot, with half of each plot supplied with sulphur and the other half not. The varietal means (mmol per kg) for free asparagine in the sulphur-fed wheat ranged from 1.521 to 2.687 in 2011–2012 and 0.708 to 11.29 in 2012–2013. Eight varieties were identified as having consistently low free asparagine concentration. There was a differential response of varieties to sulphur, and much higher levels of free asparagine in 2012–2013 versus 2011–2012. Given the short commercial lifespan of some wheat varieties, it is concluded that information on free asparagine concentration should be made available when a variety is launched. © 2017 The Authors},

Several papers have shown that interaction with macromolecular components such as protein and starch is at the base of the phenomenon: although the nature of the interaction (covalent or not) is still not clarified, the occurrence of hidden forms is generally revealed by the application of an alkaline hydrolysis procedure. In this study, an in vitro digestion model has been applied to raw maize to evaluate the possible release of hidden fumonisins under gastrointestinal conditions. Upon digestion of the food matrix, an increased amount of total detectable fumonisins was observed in comparison with the analysis on the nondigested matrix, an amount even higher than that calculated through the application of the hydrolysis procedure. Besides the analytical issues, our data have serious implications, since consumers may be exposed to a systematic higher risk than that estimated by conventional techniques. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Influence of several extraction parameters that affect PLE efficiency such as temperature, pressure, solvent extraction, number of cycles and dispersant/clean-up agents were studied. The selected PLE operating method was: 3 g of sample was packed into 11 ml stainless-steel cell and fumonisins were extracted with methanol at 40 °C, 34 atm in one cycle of 5 min at 60% flush. The analytes were ionized in ESI operating with positive ion mode and identified by selecting two monitoring transitions, permitting quantification and confirmation in a single injection. Recoveries ranged from 68% to 83% at fortification levels of 200 μg kg-1 with relative standard deviation (RSD) from 4% to 12%. The limits of quantification were from 2 μg kg-1 for FB1 and FB2, and 5 μg kg-1 for FB3, which are below the maximum residue level established by the European Union legislation in infant formulas. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of twenty seven samples of baby food products collected from different markets, and one positive sample with a content of 15.9 μg kg-1 for FB1, 9.2 μg kg-1for FB2 and 5.8 μg kg-1 for FB3 was obtained. Given the simplicity and potential of the proposed procedure, its application for safety control is recommended. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The raw extracts presents an EC 50 value of 1.39 g/L, showing more than twice higher antioxidant capacity than BHT in terms of EC 50. The crude extract antioxidant has a high content of p-coumaric and ferulic acid. The fractionation process used allowed to obtain fractions with very different antioxidant activities. The results of EC 50 have demonstrated the efficacy of a natural antioxidant extract obtained from barley husks useful as an antioxidant agent. The antioxidant extract was used to develop an antioxidant active packaging. Overall migrations of the extract from the film of LDPE-raw extract were negligible into water and fat simulant. The extract dosed on the surface of the film shows and maintains an excellent antioxidant capacity and is not separated from film in aqueous or oily media, so these can be used in a wide type of food. Industrial relevance: The use of barley husks, which is a residue of the brewing process unwieldy and unhelpful, is optimized to obtain a crude extract antioxidant. Natural extracts of phenolic compounds with high antioxidant activity were obtained after prehydrolysis and delignification of barley husks. The raw extracts show more than twice higher antioxidant capacity than BHT in terms of EC50. The crude extract antioxidant has an important feature of high content of p-coumaric and ferulic acid. The results demonstrated the efficacy of an active packaging with a natural antioxidant derived from barley husks.

The largest aflatoxin producers belong to Aspergillus section Flavi and can occur naturally in food commodities. Studies showed that molecular tools as well as the type of sclerotia produced by the strains could be helpful for identification of Aspergillus species and could be correlated with levels of toxin production. The purpose of this work was to characterize the genetic diversity using AFLP technique, the type of sclerotia and the ability of aflatoxin production by isolated strains from corn of different origins in Brazil, and to verify whether qPCR based on aflR and aflP genes is appropriate for estimating the level of aflatoxin production. All the 75 strains were classified as A. flavus and the AFLP technique showed a wide intraspecific variability within them. Regarding sclerotia production, 34% were classified as S and 66% as L type. Among the aflatoxin-producers, 52.8% produced aflatoxin B 1, while 47.2% aflatoxins B 1 and B 2. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between sclerotia production and aflatoxigenicty, and no correlation between the phylogenetic clusters and aflatoxin production. Concerning the relative expression of aflR and aflP, Pearson's correlation test demonstrated low positive correlation between the expression of the aflR and aflP genes and the production of AFB 1 and AFB 2, but showed high positive correlation between aflR and aflP expression. In contrast to the other reference strains, A. oryzae ATCC 7282 showed no amplification of aflR and aflP. The results highlight the need for detection of reliable and reproducible markers with a high positive correlation with aflatoxin production. © 2011 KNPV.},

Studies suggest that oats can be tolerated in the gluten-free diet by a majority of patients with coeliac disease. Concerns remain, however, about the possibility of contamination of commercially available oat products by wheat, barley and rye. The R5 ELISA allows the identification and quantification of wheat, barley and rye prolamins, and has demonstrated significant contamination in a range of products. If patients with coeliac disease are to take oats, it is important that those consumed are free of contamination.

The 30 HAP and source categories were identified in EPA's Urban Air Toxics Strategy (published in 1999) and the EPA was under a Court Order to complete Generally Achievable Control Technology (GACT) regulations for the remaining source categories by 12/16/2010. A discussion covers regulatory update information; technical insights on area source standards applicable to many industries, e.g., the Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engine (RICE) GACT rule and the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boiler GACT rule; compliance activities; issues encountered with regard to the RICE GACT, e.g., the inability to retrofit crank case controls on RICE to meet metal HAP control requirements for non-emergency compression ignition RICE 300 HP without invalidating manufacturer's warranties; compliance with CO control standards; emission standards for solid fuel units; management practices on oil-fired units; and identifying cost-effective energy conservation measures.

   abstract = {Indirect effects of insect control strategies on weed populations are important to consider when developing robust integrated pest management strategies. Weed seed predation rates were investigated in corn managed under three contrasting treatments based on control practices for corn rootworm: (1) the transgenic crop Cry3Bb Bt corn, (2) the broad-spectrum insecticide tefluthrin, and (3) no insecticide control. This 2-yr field study conducted near Ithaca, NY, involved quantifying seed loss from velvetleaf, common lambsquarters, and giant foxtail in arenas with and without vertebrate exclosures. Velvetleaf and giant foxtail were unaffected by the insecticide treatment; however, average seed predation of common lambsquarters was lower in both the Bt corn (11.9%) and insecticide-treated plots (11.8%) compared with control plots (17.5%) that did not receive any insecticide. Seed predation of common lambsquarters was not affected by the vertebrate exclosure. Lower seed predation in the transgenic Bt corn and insecticide treatments was likely due to nontarget effects on carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Although the reduction in seed predation was modest and limited to only one of the three weed species tested, our results highlight the need for greater risk assessment that includes the ecosystem service of weed seed predation when considering insect pest management options.},

Rice is major crop in these regions and can potentially pose serious health risks due to its known As accumulation potential. Sulfur (S) is an essential macronutrient and a vital element to combat As toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of S with regards to As toxicity in rice under different S regimes. To achieve this aim, plants were stressed with AsIII and AsV under three different S conditions (low sulfur (0.5. mM), normal sulfur (3.5. mM) and high sulfur (5.0. mM)). High S treatment resulted in increased root As accumulation, likely due to As complexation through enhanced synthesis of thiolic ligands, such as non-protein thiols and phytochelatins, which restricted As translocation to the shoots. Enzymes of S assimilatory pathways and downstream thiolic metabolites were up-regulated with increased S supplementation; however, to maintain optimum concentrations of S, transcript levels of sulfate transporters were down-regulated at high S concentration. Oxidative stress generated due to As was counterbalanced in the high S treatment by reducing hydrogen peroxide concentration and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. The high S concentration resulted in reduced transcript levels of Lsi2 (a known transporter of As). This reduction in Lsi2 expression level is a probable reason for low shoot As accumulation, which has potential implications in reducing the risk of As in the food chain. © 2015.},

   abstract = {Molds and their mycotoxins are an expensive problem for the malting and brewing industries. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that is associated with Fusarium spp. These fungi frequently cause Fusarium head blight in wheat and barley in the midwestern region of the United States; Manitoba, Canada; Europe; and China. Barley growers and malt producers would benefit from a postharvest control method for mold growth and DON production. We evaluated the use of gaseous ozone (O 3) for preventing Fusarium growth and mycotoxin production while maintaining malt quality characteristics. Micromalting was performed in three replications under standard conditions. Ozone treatment was applied to malting barley during steeping via a submerged gas sparger. Ozone treatment conditions were 26 mg/cm 3 for 120 min after 2 and 6 h of steeping. The effects of gaseous ozone on DON, aerobic plate counts, Fusarium infection, and mold and yeast counts of barley throughout the malting process were measured. Various quality parameters of the malt were measured after kilning. Statistical tools were used to determine the significance of all results. Ozonation of malting barley during steeping did not lead to significant reductions in aerobic plate counts but did lead to a 1.5-log reduction in mold and yeast counts in the final malt. The influence of gaseous ozone on DON concentration was inconclusive because of the low initial concentrations of DON in the barley. Ozone significantly reduced Fusarium infection in germinated barley. Gaseous ozone did not negatively influence any aspect of malt quality and may have subtle beneficial effects on diastatic power and β-glucan concentrations.

To accommodate for the intended use of glyphosate on corn gromwells, the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRL on borage seeds from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, since the MRL for corn gromwell seeds in the above cited Regulation is covered by the value set on borage seeds.

Import tolerance proposals of 0.05 mg/kg on coffee beans and of 0.01* mg/kg on rice were derived from the submitted residue trials. However, since the highest tolerance value established on coffee beans in the exporting countries is set at 0.03 mg/kg, EFSA proposes to maintain in the EU legislation the MRL value of 0.03 mg/kg reported under Regulation (EU) No 2015/845. No change is necessary for rice, as the MRL value is currently set at the default limit of quantification of 0.01 mg/kg. (C) European Food Safety Authority, 2016},

   abstract = {In cereals, the presence of soluble polysaccharides including (1,3;1,4)--glucan has downstream implications for human health, animal feed and biofuel applications. Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench is a versatile crop, but there are limited reports regarding the content of such soluble polysaccharides. Here, the amount of (1,3;1,4)--glucan present in sorghum tissues was measured using a Megazyme assay. Very low amounts were present in the grain, ranging from 0.16%-0.27% (w/w), while there was a greater quantity in vegetative tissues at 0.12-1.71% (w/w). The fine structure of (1,3;1,4)--glucan, as denoted by the ratio of cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl residues, was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ranged from 2.6-3:1 in the grain, while ratios in vegetative tissues were lower at 2.1-2.6:1. The distribution of (1,3;1,4)--glucan was examined using a specific antibody and observed with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Micrographs showed a variable distribution of (1,3;1,4)--glucan influenced by temporal and spatial factors. The sorghum orthologs of genes implicated in the synthesis of (1,3;1,4)--glucan in other cereals, such as the Cellulose synthase-like (Csl) F and H gene families were defined. Transcript profiling of these genes across sorghum tissues was carried out using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, indicating that, as in other cereals, CslF6 transcripts dominated.},

According to EFSA the data on rape seed are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0.03 mg/kg extrapolated to borage and corn gromwell seeds. Although the rape seed samples were analysed for picloram and its conjugates, expressed as picloram, EFSA is of the opinion that the trials can be used to derive a MRL according to the current enforcement residue definition limited to picloram. This MRL proposal might slightly overestimate the actual magnitude of picloram residues. However, since the total residues in rape seed are very low, this discrepancy is considered of low relevance. Although the chronic and acute dietary intake for borage and corn gromwell seeds could not be calculated since there is no reported consumption data for these crops, EFSA concludes that the intended use of picloram on borage and corn gromwell seeds will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern.

Forty-eight fungal and four bacterial metabolites were detected in fonio, while 28 fungal and two bacterial metabolites were found in sesame. Altogether, 55 metabolites were identified in both grains, 18 of which are reported for the first time to naturally occur in cereals and oil seeds. The metabolite concentrations reached 7,280 μg/kg in fonio for aurofusarin and 64,600 μg/kg in sesame for kojic acid. Aflatoxin contaminated 81 % of fonio samples at concentrations less than the 4 μg/kg maximum allowable limit (MAL) set by European Union (EU). In contrast, aflatoxin was not detected in sesame. Zearalenone levels exceeded the EU MAL (75 μg/kg) in one sample of fonio (987 μg/kg). About 62.5 % (30 out of 48) of the metabolites without regulations occurred in more than 50 % of samples of one or both seeds, while 3-nitropropionic acid, beauvericin, brevianamid F, curvularin, emodin, equisetin, macrosporin A, monocerin and tenuazonic acid were the most prevalent, occurring in all samples of either fonio, sesame or both. This is the first study reporting mycotoxin contamination in sesame in Nigeria and the broad range of microbial metabolites in millet and sesame. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal with no defined biological function. It is provided to environment mostly through effluent from sewage sludge, mining, burning, industries and fertilization with phosphate. Cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) results in negative effect on plant growth. It inhibits physiological activities, such as photosynthesis, respiration, mineral nutrition, and cell elongation, leading to low yield and poor growth. Cadmium damages the photosynthesis system by lowering chlorophyll content and preventing stomata opening. The discrepancy in genotype, cellular distribution, and binding forms of cadmium has a significant role in rice tolerance and cadmium accumulation. Current progress on heavy metals and their interaction with important elements has widely increased our understanding of toxicity in the plants. In this review, the important aspects of cadmium uptake and effects in rice growth, yield, and yield components elucidated.},

   abstract = {In this study, the microbiological quality of irradiated brown rice, ready-to-eat pre-cut fresh fruits, and mixed vegetables was determined. Results showed that irradiation of brown rice at 1 kGy resulted in the decrease of the microbial contaminants up to two months of storage and was found to be undetected from the third up to the fifth month. Irradiation of brown rice did not affect its overall sensory acceptability. Also, the dose of 1 kGy was found to be effective enough to significantly reduce the level of microbial contamination in all the pre-cut fresh fruits and mixed vegetables and prolonged the shelf-life of the mixed vegetables up to 4 days. Thus, the obtained results guarantee the microbiological safety of the irradiated food. It is therefore recommended for serving to immuno-compromised patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

This study was conducted to explore the possibility of selenium (Se) detoxification on Sb toxicity in paddy rice in order to find a feasible method to reduce the health risk of Sb pollution. Seedlings of paddy rice were exposed to 5mgL-1 Sb (KSbC4H4 O7 1/2H2O), in the presence of Se (Na2SeO3) at 0.1, 1, 5mgL-1 in culture solution, with no Sb and Se addition as the control. Paddy rice took up Sb greatly and the highest Sb contents measured among all treatments in this experiment in the leaves, stems and roots were 65.5, 298.5 and 195.7mgkg-1, respectively. Without Sb addition in the solution, single exposure to 0.1mgL-1 Se remarkably reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in paddy ricedemonstrating the beneficial effect of Se at low dosages. The addition of 5mgL-1 Sb was found to generate toxicity to paddy rice, showing as decreased biomass and increased leaf MDA content in paddy rice, while addition of 1mgL-1 Se mitigated the toxicity of Sb, as seen with the decreased leaf MDA content and increased biomass, indicating antidotal role of Se to Sb. In addition, the presence of 0.1, 1, 5mgL-1 Se generally decreased the accumulation of Sb in the leaves, stems and roots in paddy rice. Toxicity was also seen when paddy rice was exposed to single Se at 1 and 5mgL-1 levels, however, 5mgL-1 Sb addition was found to decrease the contents of Se in the leaves/stems whereas increased them in roots, accompanied with decreased MDA contents and increased biomass in paddy rice, indicating a possible detoxification role of Sb to Se too. Therefore, Sb, although toxic, could also be an antitoxin to Se in paddy rice at certain condition. Our results showed that Se could alleviate Sb toxicity efficiently in paddy rice through two effects as antagonism and antioxidation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The possible role of natural phenolic compounds in inhibiting fungal growth and toxin production has been of recent interest as an alternative strategy to the use of chemical fungicides for the maintenance of food safety. Fusarium is a worldwide fungal genus mainly associated with cereal crops. The most important Fusarium mycotoxins are trichothecenes, zearalenone, and fumonisins. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of four natural phenolic acids (caffeic, ferulic, p-coumaric, and chlorogenic) for the control of mycelial growth and mycotoxin production by six toxigenic species of Fusarium. The addition of phenolic acids to corn meal agar had a marked inhibitory effect on the radial growth of all Fusarium species at levels of 2.5 to 10 mM in a dose-response pattern, causing total inhibition (100%) in all species except F. sporotrichioides and F. langsethiae. However, the effects of phenolic acids on mycotoxin production in maize kernels were less evident than the effects on growth. The fungal species differed in their responses to the phenolic acid treatments, and significant reductions in toxin concentrations were observed only for T-2 and HT-2 (90% reduction) and zearalenone (48 to 77% reduction). These results provide data that could be used for developing pre- and postharvest strategies for controlling Fusarium infection and subsequent toxin production in cereal grains.

Despite comparable PP-inhibitory capacity, MCs differ greatly in their acute toxicity, thus raising the question whether this discrepancy results from MC-specific toxikokinetic rather than toxicodynamic differences. OATP-mediated uptake of MC congeners MCLR, -RR, -LW and -LF was compared in primary human hepatocytes and HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human OATP1B1/. SLCO1B1 and OATP1B3/. SLCO1B3 in the presence/absence of OATP substrates taurocholate (TC) and bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and measuring PP-inhibition and cytotoxicity. Control vector expressing HEK293 were resistant to MC cytotoxicity, while TC and BSP competition experiments reduced MC cytotoxicity in HEK293-OATP transfectants, thus confirming the requirement of OATPs for trans-membrane transport. Despite comparable PP-inhibiting capabilities, MCLW and -LF elicited cytotoxic effects at lower equimolar concentrations than MCLR and MCRR, hence suggesting congener selective transport into HEK293-OATP transfectants and primary human hepatocytes. Primary human hepatocytes appeared one order of magnitude more sensitive to MC congeners than the corresponding HEK293 -OATP transfectants. Although the latter maybe due to a much lower level of PPs in primary human hepatocytes, the presence of OATPs other than 1B1 or 1B3 may have added to an increased uptake of MCs. In view of the high sensitivity of human hepatocytes and currently MCLR-only based risk calculations, the actual risk of human MC-intoxication and ensuing liver damage could be underestimated in freshwater cyanobacterial blooms where MCLW and-LF predominate. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Concentrations of DL-PCBs + PCDD/Fs in milk exceeded rapidly (<15 days) the European limit value and approached steady state after 5 weeks. The decontamination kinetics in milk included first a rapid elimination phase (<10 days) followed by a slower elimination phase of 33, 51, and 59 days for DL-PCBs, NDL-PCBs, and PCDD/Fs, respectively. Therefore, in lactating goats, PCBs and PCDD/Fs contaminated forage raises concerns in terms of food safety.

Challenges during the development of single kernel near infrared (SK-NIR) spectroscopy applications are modifications of existing NIR technology to present single kernels for scanning as well as modifying reference methods for the trait of interest. Numerous applications have been developed, and cover almost all cereals although most have been for key traits including moisture, protein, starch and oil in the globally important food grains, i.e. maize, wheat, rice and barley. An additional benefit in developing SK-NIR applications has been to demonstrate the value in sorting grain infected with a fungus or mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol, fumonisins and aflatoxins. However, there is still a need to develop cost-effective technologies for high-speed sorting which can be used for small grain samples such as those from breeding programmes or commercial sorting; capable of sorting tonnes per hour. Development of SK-NIR technologies also includes standardisation of SK reference methods to analyse single kernels. For protein content, the use of the Dumas method would require minimal standardisation; for starch or oil content, considerable development would be required. SK-NIR, including the use of hyperspectral imaging, will improve our understanding of grain quality and the inherent variation in the range of a trait. In the area of food safety, this technology will benefit farmers, industry and consumers if it enables contaminated grain to be removed from the human food chain. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Fungal contamination negatively affects the production of cereal foods such as arepa loaf, an ancient corn bread consumed daily in several countries of Latin-America. Chemical preservatives such as potassium sorbate are applied in order to improve the arepa's shelf life and to reduce the health risks. The use of natural preservatives such as natural fermented products in food commodities is a common demand among the consumers. Kefir is a milk fermented beverage obtained by fermentation of kefir grains. Its antibacterial and probiotic activity has been exhaustively demonstrated. Our objectives were to determine the antifungal effect of kefir fermented milk on Aspergillus flavus AFUNL5 in vitro and to study if the addition of kefir fermented milk to arepas could produce shelf life improvement. We determined the antifungal effect on solid medium of kefir cell-free supernatants (CFS) obtained under different fermentation conditions. Additionally, we compared the antifungal effect of kefir CFS with that obtained with unfermented milk artificially acidified with lactic plus acetic acids (lactic and acetic acids at the same concentration determined in kefir CFS) or with hydrochloric acid. Finally, kefir was added to the corn products either in the loaf recipe (kefir-baked arepas) or sprayed onto the baked-loaf surface (kefir-sprayed arepas). The loaves' resistance to natural and artificial fungal contamination and their organoleptic profiles were studied. The highest fungal inhibition on solid medium was achieved with kefir CFS produced by kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3. Other CFS obtained from different fermentation conditions achieved less antifungal activity than that mentioned above. However, CFS of milk fermented with kefir grains, until pH 4.5 caused an increase of growth rates. Additionally, CFS produced by kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3 achieved higher antifungal activity than CFS from artificially acidified milk with organic acids (CFS L + A) at the same concentration of kefir CFS. Besides, CFS from milk acidified with hydrochloric acid (CFS HCl) showed no fungal inhibition. On the other hand, kefir-baked arepas exhibited significant resistance to natural and artificial fungal contamination. Finally, both kefir-baked and kefir-sprayed arepas retained the organoleptic characteristics of the traditional corn product, but with certain tastes imparted by the kefir fermentation. This work constitutes the first study on fungal inhibition by kefir-fermented milk extending to the protection of corn products of mass-consumption and the possible application as a food preservative. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {A multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach is described for the simultaneous detection of DNA from four common cereal ingredients in foods: wheat, barley, rye and oats. The method uses species-specific MLPA half-probes targeting DNA fragments from the ribosomal internal space transcriber (ITS) region for the detection of barley and oats, and from the genes encoding the low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin and the ω-secalin for wheat and rye, respectively. After hybridization, the probes are ligated and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) into specific and size-differential amplicons that are simultaneously detected by capillary electrophoresis. The cereal MLPA technique showed an optimal specificity against a representative number of plant and animal species. A sensitive detection of the targets (LOD of 50 mg kg−1) was achieved in a reference model cake experimentally spiked with different levels of each wheat, barley, rye and oats seeds. MLPA applicability was assessed through the analysis of 40 commercial food products with different labeling declarations regarding the targets (contain, may contain and do not declare/gluten free), indicating the presence of non-declared cereal ingredients in some of the tested samples. MLPA results were further confirmed by simplex Taqman real-time PCR assays. The described MLPA technique is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening the presence of low amounts of wheat, barley, rye and oats in processed foodstuffs, contributing to compliance with authenticity legal requirements and protecting consumers from fraudulent commercial practices or adventitious contamination which may lead to allergic reactions associated to cereal proteins ingestion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance could help breeders to develop resistant maize varieties. In this study, a set of six tropical maize inbred lines previously identified as resistant or susceptible under natural field conditions were evaluated for response to A. flavus colonisation and aflatoxin contamination. Fungal biomass was significantly higher (P<0.05) in susceptible than resistant maize inbred lines, and this was highly correlated (P=0.001) to aflatoxin levels. Maize inbred lines MRI, MR2 and MR3 had low fungal biomass and low aflatoxin levels, suggesting that resistance in these lines was mediated through restricted fungal colonisation and establishment. Among the three putatively resistant inbred lines mentioned above, MR2 had a relatively high colonisation compared to the other two lines, revealing that A. flavus could establish and colonise kernels that were injured during inoculation, but did not contain high levels of aflatoxin. This could signify the presence of host genes that interfere with the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Red rice in the US is an aggressive weed that reduces the yield of rice and contaminates its grain. It is the same species as rice, which provides an opportunity for intercrossing. This genetic similarity complicates the management of red rice in fields and rice mills, but also indicates a potential for its use in rice breeding or niche markets. Physicochemical and cooking quality characteristics, which are important components of consumer desirability for rice, are virtually unknown for red rice. Thus, a survey of red rice accessions and rice × red rice crosses was conducted to characterize these traits. Grain amylose levels of most indigenous red rice accessions were similar to those of high amylose indica cultivars from Asia. Amylose levels in crosses were highly variable, ranging as low as those in medium-grain commercial rice to as high as those in long-grains. Alkali spreading value was generally greater in awned than in awnless red rice accessions and the aroma chemical, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, was detected in two red rice crosses. The generally high seed amylose levels in red rice indicate that its cooking quality would not be suitable for most common uses of US rice, but may be acceptable for niche uses.},

   abstract = {Background: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). Design: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. Results: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). Conclusions: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.},

   abstract = {Fluoride (F-) is a geogenic contaminant which is reported to be hazardous for human health. Considering the present groundwater F- contamination scenario particularly in India, development of a technology for efficient F- removal is an urgent need. The present study assessed the suitability of nanosized rice husk biochar in removal of F- from aqueous solution. The nanoscale adsorbent prepared by a facile technique showed very high removal efficiency (90% removal) using minimum adsorbent dose (1gL-1) and less contact time period (60min). The sorption equilibrium data fitted well to both Freundlich (R2 = 0.995) and Langmuir (R2 = 0.991) isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity observed were 12.6mgg-1 and 21.7mgg-1 for Freundlich and Langmuir respectively, Nanosized rice-husk biochar showed better adsorption capacity as compared to other biomass based adsorbents. The sorption data showed better fit to the pseudo second-order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first-order kinetic model. The novel nanomaterial derived from an agricultural waste product could remove F- from aqueous solution in a promising and cost-effective way indicating that it might be an excellent choice for the removal of F- from contaminated groundwater. © 2017.},

Thus, the objective of the present work is to evaluate the centesimal composition, caloric value, pH, total titratable acidity, and coloration of polished white rice subjected to different doses of Co60 gamma radiation (0 kGy, 6.5 kGy, and 7.5 kGy). The results demonstrated that while gamma radiation did not cause significant alterations in the centesimal composition, caloric value, and titratable acidity of the rice, increasing doses substantially decreased the pH and intensified the coloration. Under controlled radiation conditions, a 6.5-kGy dose can render rice safe for consumption without significantly compromising its physical and physicochemical properties.},

   abstract = {Ninety percent of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asia. Millions of rice producers are resource-poor farmers with a rice area of less than one hectare. Yield increase and the introduction of double-cropping systems have ensured that rice production has kept up with an increasing demand. However, the increased quantities of grain and the second harvest, which is often in the wet season, have increased the problems in traditional postharvest systems. This can be particularly severe in the humid tropics, where post-harvest losses occur because of outdated management practices and technologies, and delays in post-harvest operations. Fungal infestation of rice grains can lead to discoloration, which results in price reductions in most markets. This can also result in rice being contaminated with mycotoxins, which is less visible to consumers. Contamination with ochratoxins, aflatoxins, and other mycotoxins have occasionally been reported in the literature. In the past, this was not seen as a significant problem and the focus was on other commodities such as maize and peanuts. However, recent studies and a massive recall of food products in Japan in September 2008, including sake, shoshu, and rice crackers made from imported rice from China and Vietnam, which were tested positive for aflatoxins, and also for pesticide residues, have renewed interest in looking at mycotoxin problems in rice. Exploratory studies in the Philippines compared best practice post-harvest management with the traditional management practices often used by smallholder farmers and small processors. It was concluded that synthesis of aflatoxin B1 is very likely in suboptimal post-harvest systems, with levels far above legislative limits. This indicates that there might be a considerable mycotoxin problem in rice from smallholder post-harvest operations. Improved post-harvest management options and technologies are available for diversified small-scale post-harvest systems. Small-scale combine harvesters, affordable and simple mechanical dryers and hermetic storage systems can help to avoid delays in the post-harvest chain and thus reduce mycotoxin contamination of rice. The development of strategies to scale out these improved practices and technologies to a large number of smallholder farmers will continue to be the main challenge.},

   abstract = {In the context of global climate change, drought has become an important factor that affects the maize yield in China. To analyse the impact of drought on maize yield loss in Northeast China in current and future climate scenarios, the Composite Meteorological Drought Index (CI) is introduced to reconstruct the following drought indicators: drought accumulative days (DAD), drought accumulative intensity (DAI), and consecutive drought days (CDD). These three drought indicators are used to describe the three-dimensional characteristics of drought in this study. Sen's slope method and three-dimensional copula functions are adopted to analyse the variety of drought features, and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used to analyse the variations in maize yield. A temporal assessment of the standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) of maize from 1961 to 2014 is conducted. A panel regression model is applied to demonstrate the drought impact on maize yield at various growth stages under the RCP4.5 scenario. The results show that the drought risk level for midwest Jilin Province, western Liaoning, and eastern Heilongjiang increase with global warming in the current scenario. The shorter three-dimensional joint return periods, 44–80 yr, were mainly located in western Jilin Province, Liaodong Peninsula, and northwestern Liaoning. Eastern Heilongjiang has a slightly longer joint return period of 80–100 yr. The SYRS shows a strong statistical correlation with drought indicator variations; drought-prone regions exhibit strong positive correlations. In comparison, excess precipitation regions show strong negative correlations with drought indicators in most growth stages. Drought indicators have a relatively strong association with SYRS at the milky–mature maize growth stage, and the occurrence of drought during this period primarily determines the maize yield changes in the future. Maize yield changes are −2.04%, −2.65% and −1.57% for Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Province under the RCP4.5 scenario. These results can be used as a tool for early warning of drought risk to maize, and will accelerate the progress of drought disaster risk management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are fungal toxins produced by Aspergillus flavus. Food and feed crops get contaminated with carcinogenic aflatoxins, which often results in economic losses as well as serious health issues. Grain elevators need to unload, on average, one 50,000-pound truckload every two minutes. Current chemical and optical methods for aflatoxin detection cannot meet the screening requirements. Therefore, a high speed batch screening system with reliable accuracy is necessary. The contaminated corn kernels were prepared in our laboratory by artificial inoculation of corn ears. One hundred 200g samples were selected for analysis. To develop a high speed multispectral screening system, two high performance cameras in conjunction with dual UV excitation sources and novel image processing software were utilized to collect fluorescence images of each sample. Each camera simultaneously captures a single band fluorescence image (436 nm and 532 nm) from corn samples, and the detection software processes the images to automatically detect contaminated kernels by using a normalized difference fluorescence index. Each sample was imaged/screened four times, and screened samples were chemically analyzed for aflatoxin content. All samples were shuffled between imaging repetitions to increase the likelihood of screening both sides of every kernel. Processing time for each screening was about 0.7s, and an optimal result of 98.65% was achieved for sensitivity and 96.6% for specificity. © 2018 SPIE.},

   abstract = {A process of ethanol production from wheat straw in Iran was simulated using SuperPro Designer. Wheat is the main cereal crop in Iran. Khuzestan Province was selected as a potential location for the construction of plant. A method was developed to estimate the plant capacity. The base plant size in Khuzestan was estimated to be 316 t day−1. The effect of plant size, logistics of residue collection, wheat yield, and agreements with local farmers on the profitability was calculated, and the minimum selling price was determined for different scenarios. In addition, the sensitivity analysis and economic risk assessment were conducted. The operating cost was mainly sensitive to the wheat straw and enzyme costs. The Monte Carlo simulation results showed that the risk of the base case biorefinery is fairly acceptable at moderate to high selling prices, and increasing the plant size could lessen the risk at lower ethanol selling prices. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Rice is the major staple food for about two billion people living in Asia. It has been reported to contain considerable amount of inorganic arsenic which is toxic to pancreatic beta cells and disrupt glucose homeostasis. Articles and conference papers published between 1992 and 2017, indexed in Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, and Google scholar were used. Arsenic exposure has been associated with increased blood glucose and insulin levels, or decreased sensitization of insulin cells to glucose uptake. Several studies have shown the association between inorganic arsenic exposure and incidence of diabetes mellitus. Considerable amounts of arsenic have been reported in different types of rice which may be affected by cultivation methods, processing, and country of production. Use of certain microbes, fertilizers, and enzymes may reduce arsenic uptake or accumulation in rice, which may reduce its risk of toxicity. Combined exposure to contaminated rice, other foods and drinking water may increase the risk of diabetes in these countries. Maximum tolerated daily intake of arsenic contaminated rice (2.1 mu g/day kg body weight) has been set by WHO, which may be exceeded depending on its content in rice and amount consumed. Hence, increased prevalence of diabetes in South Asia may be related to the consumption of arsenic contaminated rice depending on its content in the rice and daily amount consumed. In this review, we have focused on the possible relation between rice consumption, arsenic contamination, and prevalence of diabetes in South Asia.},

   abstract = {Background: Wholegrain foods are known to be health-beneficial but their sensory characteristics may be a limiting factor for consumption. The scientific literature of factors influencing sensory quality of wholegrain foods is rather scarce. Scope and approach: Many cereals like rye, oats, barley and sorghum are actually used mainly as wholegrain, whereas for wheat the situation is the opposite. This review deals with factors that differentiate the sensory properties of wholegrain and bran-rich foods from those of refined cereal foods. Key findings and conclusions: Wholegrain and bran contain flavour-active compounds, flavour precursors and resistant cell wall structures causing changes in flavour and texture during processing. In wholegrain foods, different chemical constituents contribute to bitterness. Increased knowledge on flavour formation has led to the possibility to not only measure but actually also design the flavour. Structure and texture are also important determinants underlying eating quality and stability of cereal foods. Hitherto established means of modulating sensory quality and thus improving acceptability of wholegrain foods are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Glyphosate tolerance can be conferred by decreasing the herbicide's ability to inhibit the enzyme 5-enol pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, which is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in all plants, fungi, and bacteria. Glyphosate tolerance is based upon the expression of the double mutant 5-enol pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (2mEPSPS) protein. The 2mEPSPS protein, with a lower binding affinity for glyphosate, is highly resistant to the inhibition by glyphosate and thus allows sufficient enzyme activity for the plants to grow in the presence of herbicides that contain glyphosate. Based on both a review of published literature and experimental studies, the potential safety concerns related to the transgenic 2mEPSPS protein were assessed. The safety evaluation supports that the expressed protein is innocuous. The 2mEPSPS enzyme does not possess any of the properties associated with known toxins or allergens, including a lack of amino acid sequence similarity to known toxins and allergens, a rapid degradation in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, and no adverse effects in mice after intravenous or oral administration (at 10 or 2000 mg/kg body weight, respectively). In conclusion, there is a reasonable certainty of no harm resulting from the inclusion of the 2mEPSPS protein in human food or in animal feed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The level of co-extracted matrix in wheat and oat extracts obtained by the QuEChERS method (EN 15662) is high and the occurrence of free fatty acids generates a major matrix peak in TIC chromatograms (rt. 13-22. min). Matrix can compromise the analytical performance in pesticide analysis using GC-MS/MS. In order to reduce the amount and the effects of matrix we tested the effect of using six different amounts of primary secondary amine (PSA) (0, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/ml extract) with and without the addition of six different amounts of C18 (0, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/ml extract) in the dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) procedure. dSPE clean-up using 25 mg/ml extract significantly reduced the major matrix peak observed for wheat extracts. Higher amounts of PSA reduced the analytical response for iprodione and malathion. For oat extract 50-150. mg PSA/ml extract was needed to obtain equally low intensity of the matrix peak. For oat the analytical responses of the target pesticides generally increased with increasing amount of PSA. C18 had no significant effect on the intensity of the major matrix peaks and even resulted in lower analytical responses for several of the target pesticides. Based on the present study it is concluded that the optimal dSPE clean-up procedure employs 25 mg PSA/ml extract for wheat and 150 mg PSA/ml extract for oat. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Sample preparation consists of a single extraction step and a dilute-and-shoot approach without further cleanup. With a total run time of 9 min and solvent consumption below 0.3 mL per chromatographic run, the presented method is cost-effective. All toxins regulated by the European Commission with maximum or guidance levels in grain products (fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2)); deoxynivalenol (DON); aflatoxins B1, G1, B2, and G2 (AFB1, AFG1, AFB2, and AFG2); ochratoxin A (OTA); T-2 and HT-2 toxins; and zearalenone (ZEN) can be quantified with this method. Furthermore, the enniatins B, B1, A, and A1 (EnB, EnB1, EnA, and EnA1); beauvericin (BEA); 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-AcDON); fusarin C (FusC); sterigmatocystin (STC); gliotoxin (GT); and the Alternaria toxins alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT), tentoxin (TEN), and altertoxin I (ATX I) can also be quantified. For all regulated compounds, recoveries ranged between 76 and 120 %. For all other toxins, the recovery was at least 51 %.

   abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper was to analyse the present status of the information available on rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.)] cultivars with respect to its nutritional and functional characteristics. It is one of the non-conventional and under-utilized beans of South and Southeast Asia. In northeastern regions of India, it is an important crop for shifting cultivation or kitchen garden which is consumed as vegetable (tender pod) and pulse. The information gaps filling could be useful for several work proposals and for consumers and cultivators to know the nutritional strength and varied usability of the grain which in-turn can help in its commercialization. Design/methodology/approach – The approach to information collection was emphasized on nutritional strength of the grain compared to other beans of Vigna family and the varied usability among the rice bean varieties of the Himalayan Belt. FindingsThe average carbohydrate, protein, fat, crude fibre and ash content of 75 genotypes of rice bean was found 59.96 ± 2.81, 20.78 ± 2.65, 1.74 ± 1.42, 5.07 ± 1.17 and 4.44 ± 1.03 per cent, respectively. It has high quality protein with all essential amino acid in balance manner. Among the minerals, it contains calcium, iron, zinc and potassium with high bio-availability of calcium (59.8 ± 0.3 per cent). The factors such as flatulence producing saccharides, trypsin inhibitors, polyphenols, phytic acid, saponin and tannins of rice bean were reported to be in the range of 3.28-5.87 per cent, 55.12-163.98 TIU/g, 0.58-1.82 1.88-8.17, 1.2-3.1 and 0.24-1.55 per cent, respectively. The toxic compounds such as hydrogen cyanide (0.09 mg/100 g) and L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (0.36 mg/100 g) is lowest in rice bean. The nutritional advantages of rice bean over the other beans of Vigna family were required to emphasize to induce interest among the researchers, producers and consumers. Research limitations/implications – In view of the recommended daily requirements with respect of amino acids, vitamin-B and minerals, rice bean could be a major component of the diet to fulfill them. However, the scanty information available on nutritional and functional components of rice bean varieties grown in northeastern India calls for the gap filing research to explore full potential of the bean. Originality/value – The information about differences among the northeastern varieties of rice bean available on nutritional functional components essentially required the updating of research data to explore full potential and utility of the bean. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

   abstract = {Background: (1,3;1,4)-beta-Glucan is an important component of the cell walls of barley grain as it affects processability during the production of alcoholic beverages and has significant human health benefits when consumed above recommended threshold levels. This leads to diametrically opposed quality requirements for different applications as low levels of (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan are required for brewing and distilling and high levels for positive impacts on human health. Results: We quantified grain (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan content in a collection of 399 2-row Spring-type, and 204 2-row Winter-type elite barley cultivars originating mainly from north western Europe. We combined these data with genotypic information derived using a 9 K Illumina iSelect SNP platform and subsequently carried out a Genome Wide Association Scan (GWAS). Statistical analysis accounting for residual genetic structure within the germplasm collection allowed us to identify significant associations between molecular markers and the phenotypic data. By anchoring the regions that contain these associations to the barley genome assembly we catalogued genes underlying the associations. Based on gene annotations and transcript abundance data we identified candidate genes. Conclusions: We show that a region of the genome on chromosome 2 containing a cluster of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE (Csl) genes, including CslF3, CslF4, CslF8, CslF10, CslF12 and CslH, as well as a region on chromosome 1H containing CslF9, are associated with the phenotype in this germplasm. We also observed that several regions identified by GWAS contain glycoside hydrolases that are possibly involved in (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan breakdown, together with other genes that might participate in (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan synthesis, re-modelling or regulation. This analysis provides new opportunities for understanding the genes related to the regulation of (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan content in cereal grains.},

   abstract = {Background: (1,3;1,4)-β-Glucan is an important component of the cell walls of barley grain as it affects processability during the production of alcoholic beverages and has significant human health benefits when consumed above recommended threshold levels. This leads to diametrically opposed quality requirements for different applications as low levels of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan are required for brewing and distilling and high levels for positive impacts on human health. Results: We quantified grain (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content in a collection of 399 2-row Spring-type, and 204 2-row Winter-type elite barley cultivars originating mainly from north western Europe. We combined these data with genotypic information derived using a 9 K Illumina iSelect SNP platform and subsequently carried out a Genome Wide Association Scan (GWAS). Statistical analysis accounting for residual genetic structure within the germplasm collection allowed us to identify significant associations between molecular markers and the phenotypic data. By anchoring the regions that contain these associations to the barley genome assembly we catalogued genes underlying the associations. Based on gene annotations and transcript abundance data we identified candidate genes. Conclusions: We show that a region of the genome on chromosome 2 containing a cluster of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE (Csl) genes, including CslF3, CslF4, CslF8, CslF10, CslF12 and CslH, as well as a region on chromosome 1H containing CslF9, are associated with the phenotype in this germplasm. We also observed that several regions identified by GWAS contain glycoside hydrolases that are possibly involved in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan breakdown, together with other genes that might participate in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis, re-modelling or regulation. This analysis provides new opportunities for understanding the genes related to the regulation of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content in cereal grains. © 2014 Houston et al.},

   abstract = {Arkansas is the top domestic rice producer, representing nearly half of total US rice production. Sediment is one of the major pollutants in rice-producing areas of Arkansas. In order to mitigate this problem, no-till management is often recommended. No-till is not well understood by farmers who believe that no-till is less profitable due to lower yields offsetting cost savings. This study evaluates the profitability and net return variability of no-till in the typical rice (Oryza sativa L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation used in Arkansas rice production. Crop yields, crop prices, and prices for key production inputs (fuel and fertilizer) are simulated for the rotation, and net return distributions for rice, soybean, and the two-year rotation are evaluated for no-till and conventional till using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) analysis. The results indicate that both risk neutral and risk-averse rice producers would prefer no-till over conventional till management in the two-year rice-soybean rotation and that no-till soybeans contribute greatly to the overall profitability of the rotation.},

   abstract = {Four members of the UDP-Ara mutase (UAM) gene family from barley have been isolated and characterized, and their map positions on chromosomes 2H, 3H, and 4H have been defined. When the genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, the corresponding HvUAM1, HvUAM2, and HvUAM3 proteins exhibit UAM activity, and the kinetic properties of the enzymes have been determined, including Km, Kcat, and catalytic efficiencies. However, the expressed HvUAM4 protein shows no mutase activity against UDP-Ara or against a broad range of other nucleotide sugars and related molecules. The enzymic data indicate therefore that the HvUAM4 protein may not be a mutase. However, the HvUAM4 gene is transcribed at high levels in all the barley tissues examined, and its transcript abundance is correlated with transcript levels for other genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The UDP-l-Arap → UDP-l-Araf reaction, which is essential for the generation of the UDP-Araf substrate for arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan protein, and pectic polysaccharide biosynthesis, is thermodynamically unfavorable and has an equilibrium constant of 0.02. Nevertheless, the incorporation of Araf residues into nascent polysaccharides clearly occurs at biologically appropriate rates. The characterization of the HvUAM genes opens the way for the manipulation of both the amounts and fine structures of heteroxylans in cereals, grasses, and other crop plants, with a view toward enhancing their value in human health and nutrition, and in renewable biofuel production. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) contamination in rice has been a hot topic of research because of its potential risk to human health. In this study, a double haploid (DH) population derived from Zhongjiazao 17 (YK17) (an early-season indica cultivar)×D50 (a tropical japonica cultivar) was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with Cd concentration in brown rice (CCBR) and Cd concentration in milled rice (CCMR). Continuous and wide variation for CCBR and CCMR were observed among the DH population. Correlation analysis revealed a positive and highly significant correlation between the two traits. A total of 18 QTLs for CCBR and 14 QTLs for CCMR were identified in five different pot and field trials. Two pairs of QTLs for CCBR (qCCBR2-1 and qCCBR2-2, qCCBR9-1 and qCCBR9-2) and one pair of QTLs for CCMR (qCCMR5-1 and qCCMR5-2) were detected in multiple trials. The alleles increasing CCBR at the qCCBR2-1/qCCBR2-2 and qCCBR9-1/qCCBR9-2 QTLs were contributed by YK17 and D50, respectively, whereas the D50 allele at the qCCMR5-1/qCCMR5-2 QTLs increased CCMR. Eight pairs of QTLs for CCBR and CCMR, qCCBR2-2 and qCCMR2-2, qCCBR3 and qCCMR3, qCCBR4-2 and qCCMR4-1, qCCBR4-3 and qCCMR4-2, qCCBR4-4 and qCCMR4-3, qCCBR5 and qCCMR5-2, qCCBR7 and qCCMR7, and qCCBR11-1 and qCCMR11-2, co-localized on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 11, respectively. For all of these QTL pairs, except qCCBR5/qCCMR5-2, the additive effects came from YK17. In addition, four CCMR QTLs showing significant additive×environment interaction and two pairs of CCMR QTLs with bi-allelic epistatic interactions were identified. The results of this study could facilitate marker-assisted selection of breeding rice varieties with low Cd accumulation in grain. © 2018 CAAS. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V},

   abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used in various fields and is considered to be relatively biocompatible. Herein, "indirect" nanotoxicity is first defined as toxic amplification of toxicants or pollutants by nanomaterials. This work revealed that GO greatly amplifies the phytotoxicity of arsenic (As), a widespread contaminant, in wheat, for example, causing a decrease in biomass and root numbers and increasing oxidative stress, which are thought to be regulated by its metabolisms. Compared with As or GO alone, GO combined with As inhibited the metabolism of carbohydrates, enhanced amino acid and secondary metabolism and disrupted fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle. GO also triggered damage to cellular structures and electrolyte leakage and enhanced the uptake of GO and As. Co-transport of GO-loading As and transformation of As(V) to high-toxicity As(III) by GO were observed. The generation of dimethylarsinate, produced from the detoxification of inorganic As, was inhibited by GO in plants. GO also regulated phosphate transporter gene expression and arsenate reductase activity to influence the uptake and transformation of As, respectively. Moreover, the above effects of GO were concentration dependent. Given the widespread exposure to As in agriculture, the indirect nanotoxicity of GO should be carefully considered in food safety.},

Chemical fertilizers and pesticides unduly applied also lead to major impact on environment and food safety.

These compounds are toxic to humans and animals, and they are a health problem worldwide. Mycotoxin-containing feeds can cause serious diseases in farm animals and substantial economic losses. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and levels of six mycotoxins in three types of forage at retail in the state of Nuevo León, México. The hypothesis was that all types of forages were contaminated with at least one of the six mycotoxins analyzed. One hundred and twenty samples of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) used for animal consumption were collected from farms and commercial locations in the state of Nuevo León, from June to November 2013, and January 2014. The total concentrations of aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, ochratoxin, T-2/HT-2 toxins, and zearalenone were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays using Neogen Veratox mycotoxin test kits. For data analysis, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. All forage types contained mycotoxins, although the alfalfa samples showed higher mean levels of aflatoxins (2.77 μg kg-1), deoxinivalenol (470 mg kg-1), ochratoxin (32.7 μg kg-1), T-2/HT-2 toxins (93.7 μg kg-1), and zearalenone (199.6 μg kg-1). Most samples were contaminated with more than two mycotoxins, which could be a risk for animal and human health. These data showed the need to establish appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of feed contamination, particularly when mixtures with forage susceptible to fungal contamination are used for feeding livestock.},

The optimal washing conditions were 0.5 M citric acid, acid to rice protein isolate ratio of 6:1 v/w, shaking time of 1 h at room temperature. The rice protein isolate showed a significant decrease in Cd concentration and the removal efficiency was more than 95% after 2 washings at optimized conditions. Rice proteins were not degraded at all and had very little loss during citric acid washing process.

The epidemiology of this fungus is not well known and may therefore be a bigger problem than currently thought to be. A study was carried out investigating the in vitro growth characteristics of F. langsethiae isolates from contaminated oats and wheat at various temperatures; 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C. Results indicated similar growth trends of oats and wheat isolates of F. langsethiae. Wheat isolates grew significantly (p<0.001) faster than oat isolates although this difference may have been confounded by the age of cultures, with oat isolates collected one year earlier. The estimated optimum growth temperature for all isolates was 24 °C. Isolates were macro-morphologically categorized as having lobed or entire colony margins, and either possessing one of the following colony colours: white, orange or purple. Since the estimated optimum growth temperature of F. langsethiae is typical in temperate summers when small-grain cereals are flowering, it is possible that this species can infect, colonise and possibly contaminate the developing grains with HT-2 and T-2 toxins which are of food safety concern. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

Carbon ion-beamirradiation produced three rice mutants with &lt;0.05 mg Cd·kg-1 in the grain compared with a mean of 1.73 mg Cd·kg-1 in the parent, Koshihikari. We identified the gene responsible for reduced Cd uptake and developed a strategy for marker-assisted selection of low-Cd cultivars. Sequence analysis revealed that these mutants have different mutations of the same gene (OsNRAMP5), which encodes a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein. Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain. In addition, we developed DNA markers to facilitate marker-assisted selection of cultivars carrying osnramp5. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy fields, the mutants have nearly undetectable Cd in their grains and exhibit no agriculturally or economically adverse traits. Because mutants produced by ion-beam radiation are not transgenic plants, they are likely to be accepted by consumers and thus represent a practical choice for rice production worldwide.},

   abstract = {Total and inorganic arsenic (As) content in rice and rice-based diets (n = 59) obtained from supermarkets in South Australia were studied to investigate the contamination levels and whether consumption of these products pose potential health risks to young children and adults. Results show that of the 59 rice-based products, 31 (53%) exceeded the EU recommended value (100 μg/kg) of As for young children and 13 (22%) samples had higher than maximum level of 200 μg/kg recommended for adults. Arsenic content varies as rice crackers &gt; baby rice &gt; rice cakes &gt; puffed rice &gt; other rice-based snacks &gt; ready-to-eat rice. Of the 6 categories of rice-based products, except ready-to-eat rice, all others exceeded the EU recommended value for young children. Even manufacture recommended servings deliver significant amounts (0.56–6.87 μg) of inorganic As. These amounts are within the range of BMDL01 values indicated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which means the risk cannot be avoided for young children and adults considering the levels of total and inorganic As in rice-based products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Thai rice is favored by large numbers of consumers of all continents because of its excellent taste, fragrant aroma and fine texture. Among all Thai rice varieties, Thai Hommali rice is the most preferred. Classification of rice as premium quality requires that almost all grain kernels of the rice be perfectly whole with only a small quantity of foreign particles. Of all the foreign particles found in rice, rice weevils can wreck severest havoc on the quality and quantity of rice such that premium grade rice is transformed into low grade rice. It is widely known that rice millers adopt the «overdose» fumigation practice to control the birth and propagation of rice weevils, the practice of which inevitably gives rise to pesticide residues on rice which end up in the body of consumers. However, if population concentration of rice weevils could be approximated, right amounts of chemicals for fumigation would be applied and thereby no overdose is required. The objective of this study is thus to estimate the quantity of rice weevils in both milled rice and brown rice of Thai Hommali rice variety using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique. Fourier transforms near infrared (FT-NIR) spectrometer was used in this research and the near-infrared wavelength range was 780-2500 nm. A total of 20 levels of rice weevil infestation with an increment of 10 from 10 to 200 mature rice weevils were applied to 1680 rice samples. The spectral data and quantity of weevils are analyzed by partial least square regression (PLSR) to establish the model for prediction. The results show that the model is able to estimate the quantity of weevils in milled Hommali rice and brown Hommali rice with high R2val of 0.96 and 0.90, high RPD of 6.07 and 3.26 and small bias of 2.93 and 2.94, respectively. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Steeping in dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was investigated with the primary aim of reducing molds and preventing toxicity of buckwheat malt. Samples of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) obtained from Montenegrin farmers in the mountain area of northern Montenegro were steeped in 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% NaOH. The effects of these solutions on mold contamination, ochratoxin A (OTA), out-of-steep moisture content (SMC), rootlet length, total nitrogen, total soluble nitrogen (TSN), free amino nitrogen (FAN), diastatic power (DP), and color of buckwheat malt were evaluated. Steeping in 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% NaOH reduced the levels of molds from 105 to 103 CFU/g and steeping in 0.2% NaOH destroyed some of the mold genera. Steeping in 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% NaOH reduced the level of OTA, especially in 0.2% NaOH, where the level of OTA after the malting process was below food safety regulations (5 μg/kg), and in 0.3% NaOH, where the level was below the limit of detection (0.1 μg/kg). Steeping in 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% NaOH significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased levels of SMC, TSN, FAN, DP, wort color, and pH. However, it significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) the level of extract and length of rootlets. The level of OTA contamination in stored buckwheat malt, which contained Penicillium genera, significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) over a period of 60 and 90 days. Steeping in 0.2% NaOH is proposed as a method for the reduction of mold and OTA contamination during buckwheat malting as well as prevention from further OTA production during storage. © 2015 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.},

   abstract = {Daily consumption of cadmium (Cd) contaminated foods poses a risk to human health. Cultivar selection is an important method to limit Cd uptake and accumulation, however, analyzing grain Cd concentration is costly and time-consuming. Developing markers for low Cd accumulation will facilitate marker assisted selection (MAS). Inheritance studies using a threshold value of 0. 2 mg kg-1 for low and high and an F2:3 population showed that low Cd accumulation in soybean seed is under the control of a major gene (Cda1, proposed name) with the allele for low accumulation being dominant. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (F6:8) derived from the cross AC Hime (high Cd accumulation) and Westag-97 (low Cd accumulation) was used to identify the DNA markers linked to Cda gene(s) or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling low Cd accumulation. We screened 171 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers that showed polymorphism between parents on the 166 RILs. Of these, 40 primers were newly developed from the soybean genomic DNA sequence. Seven SSR markers, SatK138, SatK139, SatK140 (0. 5 cM), SatK147, SacK149, SaatK150 and SattK152 (0. 3 cM), were linked to Cda1 in soybean seed. All the linked markers were mapped to the same linkage group (LG) K. The closest flanking SSR markers linked to Cda1 were validated using a parallel population (RILs) involving Leo × Westag-97. Linked markers were also validated with diverse soybean genotypes differing in their seed Cd concentration and showed that SSR markers SatK147, SacK149, and SattK152 clearly differentiated the high and low Cd accumulating genotypes tested. To treat Cd uptake as a quantitative trait, QTL analysis using a linkage map constructed with 161 markers identified a major QTL associated with low Cd concentration in the seeds. The QTL was also mapped to the same location as Cda1 on LG-K. This QTL accounted for 57. 3% of the phenotypic variation. Potential candidate genes (genes with known or predicted function that could influence the seed Cd concentration) like protein kinase, putative Adagio-like protein, and plasma membrane H+-ATPase were found to be located in the locus of interest. Of the four SSR markers located in the region, SattK152 was localized in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase gene. SSR markers closely linked to Cda1 in seeds of soybean were identified and have potential to be used for MAS to develop low Cd accumulating cultivars in a breeding program. © 2010 Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Canada.},

There is, therefore, a growing concern to find low cost and effective ways to remove heavy metals from wastewater. In the present study, untreated corn straw was used as an adsorbent, and basic parameters for lead Pb(II) adsorption were studied. The Pb(II) adsorption was found to be dependent on contact time, pH, adsorbent dosage, initial concentration of Pb(II), and temperature. The kinetics were studied using pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, and Weber–Morris models, and the kinetic parameters were determined. The untreated corn straw particles showed the maximum adsorption capacity (15.0269 mg/g) for Pb(II). The adsorption isotherms indicated that the heat of adsorption linearly increased as the thickness of the Pb(II) layer on the adsorbent gradually increased. The studies showed that corn straw can be used as a good adsorbent material for Pb(II) removal from aqueous solutions. © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON, also called as Vomitoxin), T2 toxin and Ochratoxin A (OTA) are three fungal toxins commonly found in corn or wheat. Chromatography and Mass spectrometer are main analysis methods for testing these mycotoxins. But these methods are time consuming, difficult to operate, and high cost on human resources and economy. Immune Colloidal Gold Assay (ICGA) is a rapid testing method suitable for on-spot testing. Unfortunately, the main reason for ICGA difficult to test these three toxins simultaneously is the optimization of the testing condition and sample preparation procedures. In this study, by utilizing three different coating antigens with different concentration, three test lines were set (T-1, T-2, T-3), for detecting DON, T2 toxin and OTA, respectively. The Test Line disappears when the concentration reach 1 mg/kg (for DON), 1 mg/kg (for T2) and 5 mu g/kg (for OTA), separately. We also developed a sample preparation method by using MSPD for extraction and cleaning of the three toxins above for the simultaneously ICGA. That makes it easier for detecting toxins in wheat and for assurance of the food that can meet official limit of residue restrictions of China. The method could obviously improve the people's food safety and human health in real practice of agro-products' processing and purchasing. (C) 2017 Friends Science Publishers},

   abstract = {The interpretation of information used to defend an assessment that T. indica, the cause of Karnal bunt of wheat, has a high risk of establishing in Europe and of causing significant yield/quality losses is questioned. Karnal bunt has only established in locations that are arid or semi-arid with hot summers and cool/mild winters. There is very strong circumstantial evidence that substantial amounts of seed contaminated with teliospores of T. indica were sown in Europe in the past without the appearance of Karnal bunt. It is unlikely that sufficient numbers of teliospores would survive long enough on the soil surface under European conditions and then synchronise germination during the period at heading when wheat is vulnerable to infection to guarantee disease expression. Karnal bunt is regarded as a minor disease everywhere it occurs. Almost two thirds of European wheat cultivars inoculated by a severe boot injection method have been categorised as either resistant or highly resistant to T. indica. Yield/quality losses would be expected to be low even if the pathogen were capable of establishing in Europe. The status of T. indica as an important quarantine pest is based on the indirect economic consequences of the appearance of the pathogen and not on the direct damage it causes to wheat crops. Arguments in this and previous reviews advocating a more reasoned and comprehensive assessment of the threat to Europe, North America and other locations from T. indica need to be taken into consideration in any new pest risk analyses. © 2008 KNPV.},

Approximately one quarter of the world's food crops (mainly cereals) are affected by mycotoxins such as DON. A rapid and non-destructive method to evaluate the quality and safety of grains is therefore required to eliminate these toxins from the food chain. The first portable acoustic device that predicts the concentration of DON in cereal grains has been developed using a broadband capacitive ultrasonic transducer. An acoustic method was optimised for the rapid prediction of DON in wheat. To measure the performance of this method, a model system comprising 0-100% scabby wheat grains was prepared and a single laboratory validation was carried out. The best regression model between DON concentrations determined by the reference ELISA method and the acoustic technique was obtained at an acoustic frequency of 32.2 kHz, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9852 and a repeatability coefficient of variation of 2.1-9.3%, which is much better than the results achieved by prototype acoustic spectrometers. These data show that acoustic technology allows the online monitoring of DON in cereal grains, such as wheat, because it is possible to analyse multilayer grain beds. Sound absorption depends on the grain size and moisture content, so it is advisable to use the equipment at the point of harvest, where one strain of cereals usually dominates and the grains have a more homogeneous morphology and uniform moisture content.},

   abstract = {Aims: To identify the taxonomic differences between phytopathogenic smallspored Alternaria strains isolated from wheat kernels in Germany and Russia by a polyphasic approach. Methods and Results: Ninety-five Alternaria (A.) strains were characterized by their colony colour, their three-dimensional sporulation patterns, mycotoxin production and phylogenetic relationships based on sequence variation in translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-alpha). The examination of toxin profiles and the phylogenetic features via TEF1-alpha resulted in two distinct clusters, in each case containing Alternaria infectoria isolates (92 and 96% respectively) in the first and the Alternaria alternata, Alternaria arborescens and Alternaria tenuissima isolates (77 and 79% respectively) in the other combined cluster. The production of Alternariol, Altertoxin and Altenuene has not been reported previously in the A. infectoria species group. The isolates from Germany and Russia differ slightly in species composition and mycotoxin production capacity. Conclusions: We identified that the A. infectoria species group can be differentiated from the A. alternata, A. arborescens and A. tenuissima species group by colour, low mycotoxin production and by the sequence variation in TEF1-alpha gene. Significance and Impact of the Study: These results allow a reliable toxic risk assessment when detecting different Alternaria fungi on cereals.},

This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, + and sigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20 g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Oat-consumers had a significantly higher daily intake of fiber than those who did not use oats. Two thirds of celiac disease patients preferred to use oats in their daily diet. Even long-term ingestion of oats had no harmful effects.},

   abstract = {Pulp and paper mills are indispensable for any nation as far as the growth of the nation is concerned. Due to fast growth in population, urbanization and industrialization, the demand and consumption of paper has increased tremendously. These put high load on our natural resources and force the industry to look for alternative raw material. Rice straw is a lignocellulosic material abundantly available in wood short countries like China, India, Bangladesh, etc. and can be used as raw material for this industry. Open burning of rice straw releases noxious green house gases to the air and poses serious threats to global air chemistry and human health. So, it is a dual benefit option (for farmers and industries) to use rice straw as a raw material in pulp and paper industry. Organosolv pulping using acids are the prominent choices of researchers to convert this residue into valuable pulp but in developed countries only. Developing world favours the soda and soda-AQ processes as these are economical. As a virtue of less lignin content in comparison to wood, rice straw requires less harsh conditions for cooking and can be easily pulped. Bleaching is a crucial step of paper making but also responsible for causing water pollution. Many studies revealed that during the process more than 500 chlorinated compounds are released that are highly toxic, bioaccumulative and carcinogenic in nature. Most of the industries over the globe switch on to the elemental chlorine free short sequence bleaching methods using chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. This paper presented the effective need of ecofriendly, economically reliable pulping and bleaching sequences in case of rice straw to eliminate the problems of chlorinated compounds in wastewater of paper mills. Such approach of using waste as a raw material with its environmentally safe processing for making paper can prove to be valuable towards sustainable growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Plants have the inherent ability to detoxify xenobiotic pollutants, but they are generally poor at degrading them. The introduction of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation is aimed at enhancing plants' potential further. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a good candidate for this purpose and has been transformed with genes encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19. The transgenic plants were more tolerant to various herbicides than nontransgenic Nipponbare rice plants, owing to enhanced metabolism by the introduced P450 enzymes. Transgenic plants were able to remove atrazine and metolachlor from soil. Field testing and risk assessment are very important for developing transgenic plants for phytoremediation. Transgenic rice plants should become useful as herbicide-tolerant crops and for phytoremediation of xenobiotic pollutants in future. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

In the present work infected seed samples of maize were collected from local markets in Egypt. Thirteen isolates of Fusarium species were initially identified by phenotype based methods then genotyped using the partial sequence of translation elongation factor-1α (TEF1-α) gene. Furthermore, fumonisin-producing isolates were identified using species-specific primers (PQF5-F/PQF5-R) and (FUM5P2-F/FUM5P2-R) based on partial sequence of FUM1 gene. The results indicated that an amplicon of 60-bp for four isolates identified as F. proliferatum and an amplicon of 70-bp amplicon for three isolates identified as F. Moniliforme were generated. Five strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) viz. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Iactis DSM 20076, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079, Pediococcus acidilactici NNRL B-5627, Lactobacillus. Sakei LB 706 and Enterococcus faecalis were screened for their ability to inhibit Fusarium isolates growth and/or bind fumonisin B1. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. Iactis DSM 20076 was the most efficient strain at removing fumonisin Bl toxin (76.67 %). However, Lb. acidophilus DSM 20079, Lb. Sakei LB 706 and P. acidilactici NNRL B-5627 showed the greatest inhibitory effect against Fusarium isolates. Therefore the use of LAB as a source of natural antimycotic and antimycotoxin agents showed promising, economical and successful strategy for preserving food products from Fusarium spoilage.},

This study aimed to investigate an alternative for utilizing cadmium-contaminated rice without compromising their health with hazard risks. First, cadmium (Cd) concentration in rice grain and crude rice oil was determined (0.203 ± 0.030 and 0.007 ± 0.002 mgCd/kg dry weight, respectively). Then crude rice oil extracted from cadmium-contaminated rice grain was studied for its anti-oxidative property using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging approach. Next, quantitative analysis of γ-oryzanol in crude rice oil was conducted. Results indicated that the level of cadmium concentration in the rice grain could cause adverse effects on human health. However, the amount of cadmium in the crude rice oil was safe for consumption. In crude rice oil anti-oxidative property, crude rice oil extracted from cadmium-contaminated rice was significantly higher than the control (P < 0.05). The concentration of γ-oryzanol in crude rice oil extracted from cadmium-contaminated rice was significantly higher than that in the control crude rice oil (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates an alternative way to use the rice grown in cadmium-contaminated areas for crude rice oil production for its anti-oxidative properties. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Due to the high consumption of these products and the potential health risk associated herewith, concerns about the safety and quality of food and feed have increased over the last decades at both governmental and consumer levels. Since it is not possible to avoid their occurrence, tremendous efforts have been performed to identify and monitor mycotoxins in food and feed to make their consumption safe. However, suitable certified reference materials (CRMs) intended for quality assurance and quality control purposes are still lacking for many mycotoxin-matrix combinations. Therefore, in the framework of a European Reference Material (ERM®) project, the first CRM for T-2 and HT-2 toxin in ground oat flakes (ERM®-BC720) was developed according to the requirements of ISO Guide 35. The whole process of ERM®-BC720 development, including sample preparation, homogeneity and stability studies and value assignment, is presented. The assignment of the certified mass fractions was based upon an in-house study using high-performance liquid chromatography isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, an interlaboratory comparison study involving 24 expert laboratories was conducted in order to support the in-house certification study. The certified values and their corresponding expanded uncertainties (k = 2) for both T-2 and HT-2 toxin in ERM®-BC720, traceable to the international system of units, are (82 ± 4) μg kg-1 and (81 ± 4) μg kg-1, respectively. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

While sophisticated chromatography-based methods are well established for regulatory testing by food safety authorities, few techniques exist to provide a rapid assessment for traders. This study advances the development of a mid-infrared spectroscopic method, recording spectra with little sample preparation. Spectral data were classified using a bootstrap-aggregated (bagged) decision tree method, evaluating the protein and carbohydrate absorption regions of the spectrum. The method was able to classify 79% of 110 maize samples at the European Union regulatory limit for deoxynivalenol of 1750 µg kg–1 and, for the first time, 77% of 92 peanut samples at 8 µg kg–1 of aflatoxin B1. A subset model revealed a dependency on variety and type of fungal infection. The employed CRC and SBL maize varieties could be pooled in the model with a reduction of classification accuracy from 90% to 79%. Samples infected with Fusarium verticillioides were removed, leaving samples infected with F. graminearum and F. culmorum in the dataset improving classification accuracy from 73% to 79%. A 500 µg kg–1 classification threshold for deoxynivalenol in maize performed even better with 85% accuracy. This is assumed to be due to a larger number of samples around the threshold increasing representativity. Comparison with established principal component analysis classification, which consistently showed overlapping clusters, confirmed the superior performance of bagged decision tree classification. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of climate conditions on deoxynivalenol (DON) content in 1800 maize samples collected from main maize growing regions in Serbia during a period of three years. DON concentration was determined by validated direct competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Presence of DON in maize samples from 2013, 2014 and 2015 years was detected in 2.5%, 96.0% and 15.5% of samples in the concentration range of 260.1-1388 mu g/kg, 260.4-9050 mu g/kg and 2523-6280 mu g/kg, respectively. The obtained results indicate that different weather conditions recorded in examined years had a significant influence on DON occurrence in maize. Extremely rainy weather conditions in maize growing season 2014 were favourable for DON production and even 292 (48.3%) samples were unsuitable for human consumption, since DON concentrations were greater than 1750 mu g/kg. However, lack of rainfall and higher air temperatures during the years 2013 and 2015 contributed to lower contamination frequency of DON. These findings confirmed that maize should be continuously monitored in order to protect human and animal population against the risk of DON contamination. Furthermore, monitoring of DON occurrence in maize from Serbia is required in order to collect data which is needed for establishing a Serbian as well as European database. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the level of contamination by fumonisins of selected corn food products that are available on the market in Silesia. The material covered by the study were samples of corn flour, corn grits, corn flakes, products for infants and young children, popcorn and samples of corn grain. In these samples the total amount of fumonisins as well as separately fumonisin B-1 and B-2 were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a fluorescence detector prior to the derivatization. Of the 106 surveyed corn foods samples, more than 1/3 (34.9%) were found contaminated by fumonisins B-1 and B-2; Fumonisin B-1 was present in 45.3% of samples, and Fumonisin B-2 in 17.0% of the samples. One sample of corn flour was found contaminated by fumonisins on the level of 6342 mg/kg, what makes that the maximum permissible level has been exceeded of more than three times. In other food products, the maximum permissible level of fumonisin was not exceeded. Exposure to mycotoxins in the analyzed corn food products is not a significant health risk to consumers.},

Our documentation of H. americanus proteins in these starch samples may have food safety implications with regard to shellfish allergies. We hypothesize that these proteins were introduced to the starch samples via process wash water used in the milling and deproteination steps in the commercial preparation of the starches analyzed. The introduction of nonhost proteins during commercial processing of starch samples that are used routinely in analytical studies indicates that these studies are using impure materials. Therefore, further study and documentation of the starch samples is required to ensure that all components of the samples are properly catalogued. © 2012 AACC International, Inc.},

In some regions, buckwheat herb is used as a functional food. In the present study, reports of in vitro studies, preclinical and clinical trials dealing with the effect of buckwheat and its metabolites were reviewed. There are numerous reports of potential health benefits of consuming buckwheat, which may be in the form of food, dietary supplements, home remedies or possibly pharmaceutical drugs; however, adverse effects, including those resulting from contamination, must be considered. There are reports of antioxidative activity of buckwheat, which contains high levels of rutin and quercetin. On the other hand, both cytotoxic and antigenotoxic effects have been shown. Reduction of hyperlipidaemia, reduction of blood pressure and improved weight regulation have been suggested. Consuming buckwheat may have a beneficial effect on diabetes, since lower postprandial blood glucose and insulin response have been reported. In addition, buckwheat metabolites, such as rutin, may have intrinsic protective effects in preserving insulin signalling. Rutin has also been suggested to have potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The literature indicates that buckwheat is safe to consume and may have various beneficial effects on human health.},

It was observed that calcium chloride was the most effective agent in acrylamide elimination; this led up to a 90% decrease in model systems. Contrary to other inorganic salts, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, which is a typical raising agent in gingerbread and biscuits, promotes acrylamide formation. Therefore, reduction or replacement of ammonium salts by sodium alternatives is recommended. However, the selection of inorganic salts in cereal products is limited also by their influence on organoleptic properties. Consumer preferences and other health aspects should be assessed due to the reported acceleration of other compound formations hazardous to health; these include hydroxymethylfurfural and 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, the effect of Rhizopus oryzae and Trichoderma reesei, which are both non-toxigenic microorganisms, on OTA, was evaluated. The mycotoxin ​​was degraded by both fungi in the exponential phase of growth. After 48 h, R. oryzae eliminated 63.5% of the mycotoxin whereas, after 72 h, T. reesei reduced it in 57.7%. OTA degradation had high (R > 0.9) and significant (p < 0.05) correlation with OTα production and carboxypeptidase A (CPA) activity, an evidence of the fact that CPA-like enzymes were directly related to OTA degradation. To show the applicability of CPA-like enzymes to mitigate OTA exposure, three different CPA sources (animal, vegetable and microbial) were evaluated and applied to contaminated wheat flour. Dough production processes used in bakeries were simulated. All CPAs were able to degrade OTA in flour (from 17 to 78.5%), produce OTα (from 2 to 8.2 ng/g) and reach conversion of 51%. Since the most promising sources were the ones from microbial origin, their use may be a strategy to mitigate the impact of OTA found in wheat flour used in bakeries so as to mitigate the risk of consumer exposure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In protectedhabitats near maize fields, Bt maize pollen containing the toxin can be drifted by wind onto host plants of Lepidoptera,and inadvertently harm lepidopteran larvae feeding on these host plants. For a heterogeneous, agriculturallandscape in Switzerland, we investigated the butterfly community of protected habitats and their potential exposureto possible cultivation of Bt maize, recorded the densities of maize pollen deposited on a butterfly host plant,simulated the effect of different pollen dispersal ranges and Bt maize adoption rates on the exposure of protectedhabitats, and explored the consequences of different buffer zones around protected habitats. On average, the 49 recordedbutterfly species showed a temporal overlap of larvae of 50.10% ± 30.09% with the maize pollen sheddingperiod. Mean maize pollen density on nettles (Urtica dioica) was 6.49 ± 13.58 pollen/cm2 (range: 0-100). Mostof the pollen was deposited close to maize fields less than 30 m distance, but pollen also drifted onto host plantsas far as 500 m away. In simulations, protected habitats were highly exposed to Bt maize pollen deposition evenat lowadoption rates of Btmaize, given thatmaize pollen is distributed to larger distances. The conflict between speciesconservation and Bt maize cultivation could be minimised by establishing buffer zones around protected habitats,where non-Bt maize is grown. The results and the known sensitivities of lepidopteran larvae to Bt suggest atleast 50 m-100 m broad buffer zones, and case-specific risk assessments for distances above 100 m. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

This study evaluates dermal exposure to chlorpyrifos in rice farmers along with providing a health risk assessment. Thirty-five rice farmers participated and completed an in-person interview, and patch technique was used to evaluate dermal exposure to chlorpyrifos. The chlorpyrifos residue was extracted from the gauze patches and quantified by gas chromatography equipped with flame photometric detector (GC-FPD). The results showed that chlorpyrifos concentrations were greater in males (526.34 ± 478.84 mg/kg) than females (500.75 ± 595.15 mg/kg). Average daily dose sampled from seven points on male and female farmers were 31.72 × 10-4, 193.32 × 10-4, 5.38 × 10-4, 190.48 × 10-4, 170.47 × 10-4, 465.91 × 10-4, and 43.04 × 10-4 mg/kg-day. The hazard quotient (HQ) at the mean and 95th percentile level was found to be greater than acceptable (HQ &gt; 1). Rice-growing farmers in this area may be at risk for adverse health effects due to continuous dermal exposure to chlorpyrifos from their improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Korean traditional rice wine, Takju and Yakju, is frequently consumed in Korea, but there have been no studies characterising the risks of ethyl carbamate in these products. In order to assess and characterise the exposure risk of ethyl carbamate in Korean traditional rice wines, ethyl carbamate was investigated by means of GC-MS. The analytical methods were optimised and validated through determining linearity, detection limit, quantification limit, recovery and precision. A total of 283 traditional Korean rice wines, including 175 Takju and 108 Yakju samples, were analysed. Exposure assessment was performed by factoring in ethyl carbamate content, daily consumption and body weight. Daily exposures of ethyl carbamate were estimated for adults in four age groups, and risks of ethyl carbamate were characterised by the margin of exposure, which is more than 10 000. Based on this study, the risks of ethyl carbamate in Korean traditional rice wine were shown to be of low concern. © 2016 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.},

Likewise, time-dependent total antioxidants in contaminated polished rice were significantly decreased to 13-22 mM at 72 h post-incubation than in control demonstrating that the mine-impacted polished rice was associated with oxidative damage and decrement of the total antioxidants.

   abstract = {The potential and limitation of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method was investigated to develop an accelerated spectroscopic method as an alternative analytical technique to commonly used wet chemical methods for fumonisin analysis in maize. SERS spectral difference among groups of ground maize samples with different concentrations of fumonisins more clearly reflected the level of fumonisin contamination and its effect on physicochemical properties of ground maize samples than conventional Raman spectral difference. In general, chemometric classification models exhibited moderately acceptable correct classification rates (68.0-100.0 % for training dataset and 58.8-85.3 % for validation dataset) and no or little false-negative error. The k-nearest neighbor models applied to validation dataset slightly outperformed over other classification models, showing correct classification rates of 70.6-79.4 %. Chemometric quantification models using validation dataset also yielded a good predictive power and ability, showing satisfactory regression quality (slope = 0.902-1.096), high coefficient of determination (r (2) = 0.825-0.940), and low root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP = 11.162-19.954 mg/kg), with no statistical significant difference with the reference value. The multiple linear regression models showed better quality of linear regression (slope = 0.902-1.076), stronger correlation coefficient (r = 0.948-0.969), and higher predictive accuracy (r (2) = 0.900-0.940) than other quantification models. The proposed SERS method would be a suitable and convenient analytical tool with a great potential for improvement in qualitative and quantitative characterization of fumonisins in maize, serving as a valuable screening tool for maize samples contaminated with fumonisins at a point of sampling.},

   abstract = {The safety of gluten-free foods is essential for celiac disease (CD) patients to prevent serious complications. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are recommended for gluten analysis to monitor the compliance of gluten-free products to the Codex threshold of 20 mg gluten/kg. However, due to the specific features of each gluten ELISA test kit, the results often deviate systematically and largely depend on the characteristics of the antibody. This comprehensive study assessed the specificities and sensitivities of three monoclonal (R5, G12, and Skerritt) and two polyclonal antibodies to the alcohol-soluble prolamin and alcohol-insoluble glutelin fractions of gluten from wheat, rye, and barley, all of which harbor CD-active epitopes. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography served as independent reference method to quantify gluten protein concentrations and allow comparisons of different gluten fractions within one kit and between kits. Wheat prolamins were detected quite accurately by all antibodies, but high variability between antibody specificities and sensitivities was observed for rye and barley prolamins and rye glutelins, and the largest discrepancies were found for wheat and barley glutelins. The gluten content (sum of prolamins and glutelins) was either overestimated up to six times (rye) or underestimated up to seven times (barley). Overestimation of gluten contents may unnecessarily limit the availability of gluten-free products, but underestimation represents a serious health risk for CD patients. It is important to consider these differences between antibodies used in kits and consider what each kit is capable of measuring, especially with samples where the source of gluten is unknown.},

   abstract = {Multi-analyte immunoassays have attracted increasing attention due to their short assay times, low sample consumption, and reduced detection costs per assay. In this work, we describe a homologous and high-throughput multi-wavelength fluorescence polarization immunoassay (MWFPIA) for the multiplexed detection of mycotoxins. Three typical Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin and fumonisin B1 (FB1), were labeled with different dyes. Tracers and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were employed in the MWFPIA to simultaneously detect the three mycotoxins. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection using MWFPIA were 242.0μgkg-1 for DON, 17.8 μg kg-1 for T-2 toxin and 331.5μg kg-1 for FB1, providing sufficient sensitivity to meet the action levels of these three contaminants in maize as set by the European Union. The use of a methanol/water (2:3, v/v) mixture for sample pretreatment allowed recoveries ranging from 76.5-106.3%, with coefficients of variation less than 21.7%. The total time of analysis, including sample preparation, was less than 30 min. Twenty naturally contaminated maize samples were tested using MWFPIA and HPLC-MS/MS, with correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.97 for DON and 0.99 for FB1. By changing the targets of interest, homologous MWFPIA, a method with high sensitivity, a simple procedure and a short analysis time, can easily be extended to other chemical contaminants. Thus, MWFPIA represents a versatile strategy for food safety analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Fast and easy multiplex screening could be thought as a useful tool for detection of multi-contaminated food and feed commodities. RESULTS: A highly sensitive immune-affinity monolithic arrays for detecting the mycotoxins zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and fumonisin B1 were fabricated using UV induced co-polymerisation. The mycotoxin antibodies firstly reacted with functional monomer to form antibody/functional monomer bio-conjugates. Subsequently, the antibody/functional monomer bio-conjugates co-polymerised with cross-linker to form mycotoxins immune-affinity arrays. With optimal fabrication conditions, all mycotoxin immune-affinity monolithic arrays exhibited a linear response spanning three orders of magnitude. And the immune-affinity monolithic array has a low detection limit and has a good uniformity (intra-assay CV, and inter-assay CV both &lt;8%). CONCLUSION: The fabricated mycotoxin immune-affinity monolithic arrays were proved as a sensitive, stable and economical tool in real food samples detection. Moreover, the mycotoxin immune-affinity monolithic arrays would be able to minimise manipulation steps: add samples and enzyme labelled mycotoxins, and detect CL signals. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

We studied the accumulation of microcystins, growth, and photosynthesis in rice exposed to different concentrations microcystins (0, 1, 100, 1,000, and 3,000 μg L−1) for 7 days and then without microcystins for 7 days. After a 7-day exposure, the accumulation of microcystins in roots was the highest. High concentration microcystins (≥100 μg L−1) inhibited growth, and decreased photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. The decrease was positively correlated with microcystins concentrations. After a 7-day restoration, the accumulation of microcystins in organs was lower than that during the exposure period. The dry weight of roots and leaves in rice seedlings treated with 100 μg L−1 was not significantly different from those of the control, although photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content in rice seedlings treated with 100 μg L−1 were still lower than those of the control. However, growth and photosynthesis in rice seedlings treated with 1,000 or 3,000 μg L−1 microcystins were still lower than those of the control, even worse than those during the exposure period, indicating an irreversible inhibition of microcystins to plants at high concentrations of microcystins. Our results imply that irrigation with microcystin-contaminated water must be monitored and controlled to avoid harmful accumulation of microcystins and damage to plant growth. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Hence, we studied growth, yield and grains quality of rice as well as accumulation of microcystins in different tissues of rice at booting stage exposed to 1, 100, 1000, and 3000 μg L−1 microcystins solution and then recovered (without microcystins). After a 7-day exposure, microcystins content in tissues was positively correlated with microcystins concentrations, and microcystins content in roots was the highest. In addition, microcystins content in grains of rice treated with 1, 100, 1000 and 3000 μg L−1 microcystins was 4.9, 7.1, 12.6 and 21.2 μg kg−1 dry weight, indicating that the microcystins in grains of rice treated with microcystins (≥1000 μg L−1) could pose a threat to human health through food chain. Low concentration microcystins (1 μg L−1) did not affect growth and photosynthesis, but high concentration microcystins (≥100 μg L−1) inhibited growth and photosynthesis. After a 7-day restoration, growth and photosynthesis in rice treated with microcystins (≥1000 μg L−1) were even worse than those during the exposure period. After maturity, yield of rice as well as protein and amylose content in grains of rice treated with microcystins (≥100 μg L−1) were all lower than those of the control.

The limit of detection ranged from 0.06 mu g kg(-1) (DEA) to 0.25 mu g kg(-1) (HA). The intra-and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the four analytes were 5.5-9.3% and 8.7-17.1% for cereal grain samples, respectively. Recoveries for the four targets at three spiked levels ranged from 71.9 to 106% with RSD of 3.1-8.1% for the cereals. The content of the analytes in cereals was determined as follows: 0.6-3.0 mu g kg(-1) for ATR and 0.6-1.6 mu g kg(-1) for DEA, while DIA and HA were not detected. The proposed method can ensure a rapid and highly sensitive analysis of atrazine and its degradation products in cereals, and can provide a direction for proper application of atrazine and a base for evaluating their hazards to food safety.},

An automated procedure for the rapid determination of EC in Chinese rice wine was developed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using propyl carbamate as internal standard, the optimized HS-SPME sampling with a polyacrylic fibre was 45 min at 70°C after applying 38.8% NaCl to saturate the sample. This method showed good linearity over a range of 25-600μgL-1 (R2 = 0.997). The recovery, relative standarddeviation and limit of detection were 90.21-97.35%, lower than 2.89% and 1.19μg L-1,respectively. Additionally, the ethanol concentration had no effect on the analysis of EC. The total analysis time of 57min per sample in continuous determination was twice as fast as the widely used solid-phase extraction-GC-MS method. This solventfree HS-SPME-GC-MS procedure is suitable for the rapid, automated, and therefore convenient, determination of EC in Chinese rice wine. © 2012 The Institute of Brewing &amp; Distilling.},

   abstract = {Mercury pollution in fields has become a potential threat to human health. Planting wheat cultivars with low mercury accumulation in slight or medium mercury-polluted fields is an efficient solution to ensure food safety. Therefore, this study evaluated the mercury resistance and accumulation characteristics of 30 generalized wheat cultivars in major wheat-producing areas of China. A modified membership function that considers the weight of each trait was used. Results demonstrated that the plant height of wheat significantly increased under both low mercury and high mercury stresses. The uppermost internode length significantly increased while the spikelet number significantly decreased under low mercury stress. Yield-related traits, including total grain number, fresh grain yield, and dry grain yield, significantly decreased under high mercury stress. The mercury concentrations in wheat grains presented a significant negative correlation with the mercury resistance coefficients of plant height (−0.38*), spike length (−0.39*), and fresh grain yield (−0.38*) under high mercury stress. The heritability of all traits reached medium to high levels, ranging from 0.31 to 0.68. This finding suggested that the investigated traits are stable and suitable for the assessment system. Selection criteria for wheat mercury resistance were established using discriminant analysis, which integrated the mercury resistance coefficients of effective tiller number, fresh grain yield, and dry biomass into the discriminant function under low mercury stress and the mercury resistance coefficients of dry grain yield and dry biomass under high mercury stress. Ultimately, Liangxing-99, Nongda-3163, and Gaocheng-8901 were screened for high mercury resistance and low mercury accumulation. These wheat cultivars could be planted in fields with low or medium mercury pollution to obtain safe grains. © 2016},

A total of 28 pigs aged 3 months were divided into two groups and fed with either non-GM (MH86 group, female n = 7, male n = 7) or GM rice (Bt group, female n = 7, male n = 7). The total dosage of Cry1Ab protein for female and male pigs was 0.972 and 0.963 mg/kg body weight by the end of final weighing date (D 75), respectively. The results showed that there were no differences in the average daily gain, average daily food intake, body weight, feed conversion ratio, oestrus cycle duration, oestrus period, litter size, serum steroids, or the birth and weaning weight of offspring between Bt and MH86 groups. All pigs (n = 28) were sacrificed to collect tissues and blood samples for the analysis of relative organ weights, blood physiological and biochemical parameters and histopathological examinations. No significant differences existed in the tested indicators except that total protein was significantly higher in the MH86 compared to the Bt group (P < 0.05). In addition, the total bilirubin in the MH86 group was higher than the Bt group for females (P < 0.05), but no difference existed in males (P > 0.05). No pathologic abnormal changes were found from histopathological examinations of the main tissues. On the basis of these results, feeding with Bt rice for 360 days did not affect the growth, reproductive performance, hematology, or organ morphology in WZSP. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   DOI = {10.1155/2018/8916393},
   abstract = {Food safety issues closely related to human health have always received widespread attention from the world society. As a basic food source, wheat is the fundamental support of human survival; therefore, the detection of pesticide residues in wheat is very necessary. In this work, the ultrasonic-assisted ionic liquid-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method was firstly proposed, and the extraction and analysis of three organophosphorus pesticides were carried out by combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extraction efficiencies of three ionic liquids with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf2N) anion were compared by extracting organophosphorus in wheat samples. It was found that the use of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([OMIM][Tf2N]) had both high enrichment efficiency and appropriate extraction recovery. Finally, the method was used for the determination of three wheat samples, and the recoveries of them were 74.8-112.5%, 71.8-104.5%, and 83.8-115.5%, respectively. The results show that the method proposed is simple, fast, and efficient, which can be applied to the extraction of organic matters in wheat samples. © 2018 Wei Liu et al.},

   abstract = {Global crop production has doubled since the Green Revolution on the average, but crop yield has stagnated or even declined in some regions. In the same time, food demand has highly increased due to population growth and higher living standards. The use of pesticides and mineral fertilizers has improved crop yields but also contaminated food and the environment, thus leading to a global food crisis. Here, we reviewed the historical trends of global pesticide and fertilizer application, cereal yields, and production. Our main findings are as follows: (1) fertilizer and pesticide consumption increased for 35-40 % of the countries; (2) cereal production in 38 % of countries and yields in 47 % of countries either stagnated or decreased from 1961 to 2010; (3) countries showing stagnated or decreased yields are countries with low gross domestic product per capita, mainly situated in Africa, South America, and West Asia. Our findings thus evidence a global imbalance in food production and the usage of fertilizers and pesticides.},

Despite the prevalence of mycotoxins in maize and other crops, the agricultural management system has not yet been fully implemented in China. Thereby, there is an urgent need to implement management programs to control mycotoxin contamination in maize and maize-based feed. Here, we conducted a survey on the traditional maize production and feed processing practices in the Hebei province. We analyzed the factors of fungal infection and subsequent mycotoxin contamination in maize and feed supply chain and management systems. Our results show that the stored maize samples from local feed mills were heavily contaminated with fumonisin, at 9638 μg/kg on the average, and deoxynivalenol, at 996.3 μg/kg on the average. We also found that more than 75.0 % of the farmers followed good agricultural practices, whereas only 38.1 % of the farmers cared for storage conditions. The main factors for mycotoxin contamination included less strict receiving and inspection criteria, inappropriate storage conditions, and poor processing practices. The critical control points were feed mill receiving, storage, and feed processing. Visual quality, moisture contents, and mycotoxin levels in maize and feed were used as monitoring parameters at critical control points. This is the first study to thoroughly explore traditional maize and feed manufacturing practices adopted by farmers. © 2016, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

The present work had the goal of determined the sample size for genetic purity evaluation, in order to protect the seed consumer and the producer and to evaluate the sensitivity of microsatellite technique for discriminating hybrids from their respective relatives and for detecting mixtures when they are present in small amounts in the samples. For the sequential sampling, hybrid seeds were marked and mixed in with the seed lots, simulating the following levels of contamination: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0%. After this, groups of 40 seeds were taken in sequence, up to a maximum of 400 seeds, with the objective of determining the quantity of seeds necessary to detect the percentage of mixture mentioned above. The sensitivity of microsatellite technique was evaluated by mixing different proportions of DNA from the hybrids with their respective seed lines. For the level of mixture was higher than 1:8 (1P1:8P2; 8P1:1P2), the sensitivity of the marker in detecting different proportions of the mixture varied according to the primer used. In terms of the sequential sampling, it was verified that in order to detect mixture levels higher than 1% within the seed lot- with a risk level for both the producer and the consumer of 0.05- the size of the necessary sample was smaller than the size needed for the fixed sample size. This also made it possible to reduce costs, making it possible to use microsatellites to certify the genetic purity of corn seeds lots.},

The constantly increasing annual production and yield is matched by demand for cereals, which is expected to increase drastically along with the global population growth. A critical food safety and quality issue is to minimize the microbiological contamination of grains as it affects cereals both quantitatively and qualitatively. Microorganisms present in cereals can affect the safety, quality, and functional properties of grains. Some molds have the potential to produce harmful mycotoxins and pose a serious health risk for consumers. Therefore, it is essential to reduce cereal grain contamination to the minimum to ensure safety both for human and animal consumption. Current production of cereals relies heavily on pesticides input, however, numerous harmful effects on human health and on the environment highlight the need for more sustainable pest management and agricultural methods.

Our experiments test whether or not the process of hardwood ash nixtamalization can mask the presence of maize in adhering carbonized residues by depleting delta C-13 values, and whether there is a reciprocal delta C-13 enrichment effect on the hardwood ash employed in nixtamalization. Overall, there is substantial delta C-13 depletion of residues when maize is cooked with hardwood ash, and hardwood ash cooked with maize shows the reciprocal enrichment.

Infants and young children are considered the highest risk group because their large dietary intake of cereal-based foods in relation to their body weight. In this study, a rapid, selective and sensitive method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of 7 trichothecenes (HT-2 toxin, T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, and fusarenon-X (FUS-X) in infant cereal food. Mycotoxins have been extracted from the samples using a modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) procedure. The method was based on a single extraction with a mixture methanol and acetonitrile, followed by an extraction/partitioning step after the addition of salt, and a cleanup step utilizing dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE). The analysis was carried out using a liquid chromatography combined with a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) by electrospray ionization in positive ion mode (ESI+) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The validated method showed to be accurate (>72% recovery), reproducible (<10% relative standard deviation interday) and sensitive for the selected mycotoxins (method detection limits ranged from 0.02 mg kg-1 to 0.15 mg kg-1). The screening of 57 samples of infant cereal food commercialized in Spain revealed the presence of FUS-X, 15-Acetyl-DON, 3-Acetyl- DON and T-2 in 9 (15.5%) samples.},

   abstract = {The metabolism of C-14-clodinafop-propargyl (CfP) was examined in cell cultures of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Heines Koga II') and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Besides the non-transgenic tobacco culture, cultures transformed separately with cDNA of human cytochrome P450-monooxygenases (P450s) CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 were examined. Experiments with wheat were executed in the presence and absence of safener cloquintocet-mexyl (CqM). After 48h of incubation, only about 10% of applied C-14 was found in media (both tobacco and wheat). Non-extractable residues of C-14-CfP in wheat cells were 16.54% (without CqM) and 30.87% (with CqM). In all tobacco cultures, 82.41-92.46% of applied radioactivity was recovered in cell extracts. In contrast to wheat, non-extractable residues amounted only to 1.50-2.82%. As determined by radio-thin layer chromatography (TLC) and -high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the parent CfP was not found in the cell extracts of wheat; in tobacco cell extracts, only traces of CfP were detected. After a hydrolysis of assumed carbohydrate conjugates of CfP derived polar C-14-labeled compounds, TLC and HPLC analysis showed that in wheat, a more complex pattern of metabolites of CfP were observed as compared to all tobacco cultures. In hydrolysates resulting from wheat, the identity of three primary products was confirmed by means of GC-EI-MS: free acid clodinafop (Cf), hydroxy-Cf hydroxylated at the pyridinyl moiety, and 4-(5-chloro-3-fluoropyridin-2-yloxy)phenol. In hydrolysates derived from all tobacco cultures, main metabolite was Cf besides only traces of further unidentified products. Differences among the different tobacco cultures (non-transgenic, transgenic) did not emerge. According to kinetics of disappearance of primary metabolite Cf as well as formation of polar soluble products and non-extractable residues, metabolization of CfP proceeded at a noticeably higher rate in wheat cells treated with safener CqM than in cells without CqM treatment. Thus, these results indicated a stimulation of CfP's metabolism by CqM, although metabolic profiles observed in CqM treated and non-treated cells (after hydrolysis) were qualitatively similar. The findings obtained from all tobacco cultures suggested that with the exception of ester cleavage to Cf, CfP cannot be metabolized by tobacco itself or by the human P450s examined.},

   abstract = {The widespread occurrence of ethyl carbamate (EC, 89.09 Da), a group 2A carcinogen, in fermented foods and alcoholic beverages has raised worldwide public health concern. Immunoassay for EC is unavailable due to the simple and small structure of EC. In this work, an initial attempt to produce antibody specific for EC, by using 4-((ethoxycarbonyl)amino)butanoic acid as hapten, was made but failed. However, since EC can easily react with 9-xanthydrol to form xanthyl ethyl carbamate (XEC), two haptens based on XEC structure were designed and synthesized. Polyclonal antibody against XEC, instead of EC was obtained and then used to develop a competitive indirect ELISA for EC via a pre-analysis derivatization. After optimization, the ciELISA was applied in analyzing Chinese rice wine with detection limit of 166 μg/L, and negligible cross-reactivity with EC analogs. Recoveries of EC in fortified samples were from 84.4% to 100.9%, with coefficients of variation below 10%. Results for analysis of real samples by the ci-ELISA correlated well with that by reference method GC-MS, suggesting the good accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed method. This is the first report of an immunoassay capable of detecting EC, which is suitable for monitoring EC in a large amount of samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

This study evaluated the effects of ozone on the detoxification of AFs in corn flour (CF) and the moisture content (MC) thereof. RESULTS: The detoxifying effects of ozone on CF became more obvious as the ozone concentration and exposure time increased. After CF was treated with 75 mg L-1 ozone for 60 min, the contents of AFB1, AFG1 and AFB2 decreased from 53.60, 12.08 and 2.42 μg kg-1 to 11.38, 3.37 and 0.71 μg kg-1, respectively, which are lower than the maximum limits of AFB1, AFG1, AFB2 and total AFs (20 μg kg-1) for CF regulated by the Chinese government. Ozonation significantly affected the MC of CF, and ozone at a higher concentration decreased the MC more drastically. After CF was exposed to 15, 30, 45 and 75 mg L-1 ozone for 60 min, the MC of CF decreased from 17.4% to below 15%, fulfilling the long-period storage requirements for CF. CONCLUSION: Ozone is potentially applicable in effectively degrading the AFs in CF and in greatly decreasing the MC of CF. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Different column design parameters like bed depth, flow rate and initial copper concentration were investigated. It was found that the equilibrium uptake (q(eq(exp))) of the ERH and RRH increased with increase in initial copper concentration but decreased with increase in flow rate and bed depth, respectively. The higher adsorption capacity and longer breakthrough time were observed for ERH in comparison with RRH, under the same conditions. Compared to coconut-shell activated carbon (C-AC), ERR was also found more effective in removing Cu2+. 0.01 mol L-1 HCl solution was used for desorption of column which was prior to absorb copper ion, and 0.01 mol L-1 NaOH solution was used for re-activation.

A competitive indirect TRFIA was conducted by simultaneously incubating ZEN in standard or extracted samples with anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody over ZEN-BSA coated plates, and then determining the bound ZEN monoclonal antibody with goat anti-mouse europium conjugate. Samples were extracted with methanol/water (70:30, v/v), then was subject directly for TRFIA without any clean-up procedure. The sensitivity of this method was 0.2 ng/ml. The measuring range of the ZEN-TRFIA was 0.2-200 ng/ml. The mean within-assay and between-assay coefficients variation of standard curve were both less than 10%. The recoveries of spiked cereals samples ranged from 76%-132%. 10 corn and 6 wheat corn samples were tested, ZEN values obtained by this method agreed well with those obtained by commercial ELISA kit. It was concluded that this new method is suitable for rapid screening of ZEN in corn and wheat. © 2009 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.},

   abstract = {Contamination of cereal commodities with mycotoxins represents a significant hazard to consumer health and is receiving increasing attention from food safety authorities and legislators. The most important mycotoxins in small cereal grains in Europe are trichothecenes, including nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin in most regions, and ochratoxin, which is a major postharvest contaminant in northern Europe. Knowledge of the pre- and postharvest stages of the cereal production chain and in particular information on where prevention strategies can be implemented is critical to the development of quality assurance systems for improving food safety. In this chapter we review the key critical control points identified in the cereal production chain for trichothecenes and ochratoxin A that must be properly handled to minimize consumer exposure to these important mycotoxins. Our summary provides useful information for the cereal production and processing industries that can be used for developing appropriate specifications and management systems for preventing mycotoxin contamination in the food chain. © CAB International 2008.},

Nirenberg culture isolated from rice in Niger State, Nigeria, previously found to be acutely toxic to mice and chicks was established to contain 8.233 ppm of total fumonisins (FBs). The present work was undertaken to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic effect to human lymphocytes of the same 4-year old extract via flow cytometry over a 3 h period in comparison with those of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and to further elucidate the mycotoxins in extract using thin layer (TLC), column (CC) and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) techniques. The efficiencies of different solvents for extraction of FBs were also determined. A dose-dependent response was obtained for all toxins tested via cytotoxicity assay. At concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml, OTA was more toxic than AFB 1 followed by the extract which was comparatively as toxic as FB1. Cytotoxicity data also revealed that, apoptosis is the major form of cell death induced by the tested mycotoxins and extract. Fumonisins B 1 (FB 1), B 2 (FB 2) and B 3 (FB 3) were found in the fungal extract at concentrations of 16.302, 6.423 and 2.456 ppm, respectively. The results also demonstrated that FBs are not extractible in hexane, benzene, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate, very low amount of the toxins can be recovered using dichloromethane (5 to 7%) and acetone (&lt;10%), while methanol, acetonitrile and their aqueous solutions (32 to 87%) were found to be the best FBs extraction solvents. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

Total variance and sampling, preparation, and analysis variance were determined and compared between plans through multifactor analysis of variance. Four theoretical distribution models were used to compare aflatoxins quantification distributions in eight maize lots. The acceptance and rejection probabilities for a lot under certain aflatoxin concentration were determined using variance and the information on the selected distribution model to build the operational characteristic curves (OC). Sampling and total variance were lower at the automatic plan. The OC curve from the automatic plan reduced both consumer and producer risks in comparison to the manual plan. The automatic plan is more efficient than the manual one because it expresses more accurately the real aflatoxin contamination in maize. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.},

The structural changes of digestive starch residues were characterized using DSC, XRD, 13C CP/MAS NMR, and ATR-FTIR. TQ starch was very susceptible to digestion; its residues following in vitro and in vivo digestion showed similar structural characteristics with TQ control starch, which suggested that both amorphous and crystalline structures were simultaneously digested. Both amorphous and the long-range order structures were also simultaneously hydrolyzed in TRS starch, but the short-range order (double helix) structure in the external region of TRS starch granule increased with increasing digestion time. The A-type polymorph of TRS C-type starch was hydrolyzed more rapidly than the B-type polymorph. These results suggested that B-type crystallinity and short-range order structure in the external region of starch granule made TRS starch resistant to digestion. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

A total of 238 samples of rice (88 produced locally or imported), maize (79, cracked or flour) and peanut paste (71) were collected in the main markets of Abidjan, Bouake and Korhogo. An UHPLC-MS/MS method allowed the analysis of 77 mycotoxins. All the peanut paste samples were contaminated by aflatoxin Bi (AFB1) with 99% exceeding the EU limits of 2 mu g kg(-1) for AFB1 and 4 mu g kg(-1) for total aflatoxins (AFT: B1 +B2+G1 +G2), and concentrations reaching up to 4535 mu g kg(-1) (AFB1) and 8094 pg kg-1 (AFT). Maize (96%) and rice (57%) samples were also contaminated by AFB1 with 58% and 24% respectively above the EU limits and maximum levels of 80 mu g kg(-1) for maize and 14 mu g kg(-1) for rice. Only 6% of the cereal samples (3 rice and one maize samples) had ochratoxin A content above the EU limit (3 mu g kg(-1)). Fumonisins and zearalenone were detected, respectively, in 91% and 8% of the maize samples, and in 18% and 5% of the rice samples but at levels below EU limits. Out of the 238 samples, 91% were contaminated with more than one mycotoxin including EU regulated mycotoxins and/or other mycotoxins mainly beauvericin (79% of the samples), equisetin (71%), aflatoxin Ml (45%), cyclopiazonic acid (32%), fumonisin B3 (29%), sterigmatocystin (24%), citrinin (18%), ochratoxin B (16%) and fusaric acid (15%).

This study determines the effects of stearic acid and xanthan gum alone and in combination on the functionality of maize, wheat, teff and cassava starches. An increase in viscosity was observed for all starches with stearic acid and xanthan gum compared to the controls with cassava having the least increase. A further increase in viscosity was observed for the cereal starches with combination of stearic acid and xanthan gum. Stearic acid reduced retrogradation, resulting in soft textured pastes. Combination of stearic acid and xanthan gum reduced the formation of type IIb amylose-lipid complexes, syneresis, and hysteresis in cereal starches compared to stearic acid alone. A combination of stearic acid and xanthan gum produce higher viscosity non-gelling starches and xanthan gum addition increases physical stability to freezing and better structural recovery after shear. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Fusarium species associated with FCR can also produce powerful trichothecenes mycotoxins that pose a considerable health risk to humans and animals that consume infected grains. In this study we examined Fusarium species of wheat from different regions of Iraq that showed FCR symptoms. Twenty-nine isolates were collected overall, and the marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alha (TEF-1α) was sequenced in order to determine their taxonomic identities. All isolates were determined to be F. culmorum, and primers targeting tri-cluster genes were used in order to further characterize isolates into specific trichothecene chemotype strains. Five of the 29 isolates were determined to be the nivalenol (NIV) chemotype, while the rest of the isolates recovered were the deoxynivalenol (DON) chemotype. All DON-type isolates produced 3Ac-DON, while the 15Ac-DON-type was not detected. The majority of the NIV-type isolates originated from wheat growing regions in the mid-latitudes of Iraq, while the DON-type isolates were recovered from areas distributed broadly across the country. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report on the distribution of specific F. culmorum chemotypes from FCR diseased wheat in Iraq. © 2017 by Oadi N. Matny.},

   abstract = {T-2 toxin is a trichothecene mycotoxin produced when Fusarium fungi infect grains, especially oats and wheat. Ingestion of T-2 toxin contaminated grain can cause diarrhea, hemorrhaging, and feed refusal in livestock. Cereal crops infected with mycotoxin-producing fungi form toxin glycosides, sometimes called masked mycotoxins, which are a potential food safety concern because they are not detectable by standard approaches and may be converted back to the parent toxin during digestion or food processing. The work reported here addresses four aspects of T-2 toxin-glucosides: phytotoxicity, stability after ingestion, antibody detection, and the anomericity of the naturally occurring T-2 toxin-glucoside found in cereal plants. T-2 toxin-β-glucoside was chemically synthesized and compared to T-2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with Blastobotrys muscicola cultures and the T-2 toxin-glucoside found in naturally contaminated oats and wheat. The anomeric forms were separated chromatographically and differ in both NMR and mass spectrometry. Both anomers were significantly degraded to T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin under conditions that mimic human digestion, but with different kinetics and metabolic end products. The naturally occurring T-2 toxin-glucoside from plants was found to be identical to T-2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with B. muscicola. An antibody test for the detection of T-2 toxin was not effective for the detection of T-2 toxin-α-glucoside. This anomer was produced in sufficient quantity to assess its animal toxicity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endometriosis is a disorder in which the endometrium forms growths outside the uterus and is associated with chronic pain. Recent evidence suggests that endometrial motility plays a role in the aetiology of endometriosis. The endocannabinoid system regulates cellular migration. Given the growing involvement of the endocannabinoids in reproduction, we investigated the role of the endocannabinoid system in migration of endometrial cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Migration of the human endometrial HEC-1B cells was assayed. Standard PCR techniques were used to determine the presence of the GPCR, GPR18, in HEC-1B cells, and p44/42 MAPK was assayed in stably transfected HEK293-GPR18 cells to determine receptor specificity for known cannabinoid agonists and antagonists. N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA) metabolism was measured, using HPLC/MS/MS for lipid analysis. KEY RESULTS AEA, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) induce migration of HEC-1B cells through cannabinoid CB1 receptor-independent mechanisms. MAPK activation in HEK293-GPR18 cells revealed novel pharmacology for known CB1 and CB2 receptor ligands at GPR18 receptors, including D9-THC, which activates MAPK at nanomolar concentrations, whereas WIN 55212-2, CP55940, JWH-133 and JWH-015, and arachidonyl-1-hydroxy-2-propylamide (R1-methanandamide) had no effect. Moreover, HEC-1B migration and MAPK activation by NAGly and Delta(9)-THC were antagonized by Pertussis toxin, AM251 and cannabidiol. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS An understanding of the function and regulation of GPR18 and its molecular interactions with endogenous ligands, and how phytocannabinoids play a role with GPR18 signalling is vital if we are to comprehensively assess the function of the cannabinoid signalling system in human health and disease.},

   abstract = {The mycotoxin contamination of cereal commodities is a much older problem than its detection and characterization. Molded grains often caused different animal and human health problems long before the causal agents were known. The first mycotoxin detected is the aflatoxin B1 in the 1960s and since then hundreds of toxins have been described (D'Mello and McDonald 1997; Bartók et al. 2006). They represent chemically very different groups, very far from each other in physiological actions; some, such as aflatoxins or fumonisins, are highly carcinogenic. The most numerous group of toxins is at present the trichothecenes with about 100 toxins and toxic degradation products. At least 90 fumonisin toxins are known (Bartók et al. 2008), most of them without physiological and toxic characterization. For now, we have a rather comprehensive view on the occurrence of the different mycotoxins in cereal grains; most of the synthesis and decomposition mechanisms of the major mycotoxins are known. It is very probable that new toxins, maybe toxic groups, will be characterized in the future. Most of the synergism between toxins is not known. It could be high, as the same severity of swine toxicoses from natural deoxynivalenol (DON) could be reached by the addition of 5-10 times more chemically clean DON (Miller and Trenholm 1994). Increasing knowledge of the toxins has verified the food and feed safety risks. Now many countries, such as EU member states (Anonymous 2005), have binding toxin regulations or suggested toxin levels, as in the USA, Canada, etc. As the EU is a significant market, EU regulations generate stricter toxin regulations in the source countries. Many accept the view that the bioethanol industry can utilize toxin-contaminated commodities. However, the industry has shown (Stepanik et al. 2007) that the ethanol yield from toxin-contaminated grain is lower, and the toxin-containing remains (dried distillery grain with solubles) provides large problems in economic utilization, because a costly detoxification is needed. This means also that non-food uses might need healthy grains. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Glycosylation is an important plant defense mechanism and conjugates of Fusarium mycotoxins often co-occur with their parent compounds in cereal-based food and feed. In case of deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-O--d-glucoside (D3G) is the most important masked mycotoxin. The toxicological significance of D3G is not yet fully understood so that it is crucial to obtain this compound in pure and sufficient quantities for toxicological risk assessment and for use as an analytical standard. The aim of this study was the biochemical characterization of a DON-inactivating UDP-glucosyltransferase from rice (OsUGT79) and to investigate its suitability for preparative D3G synthesis. Apparent Michaelis constants (K-m) of recombinant OsUGT79 were 0.23 mM DON and 2.2 mM UDP-glucose. Substrate inhibition occurred at DON concentrations above 2 mM (K-i = 24 mM DON), and UDP strongly inhibited the enzyme. Cu2+ and Zn2+ (1 mM) inhibited the enzyme completely. Sucrose synthase AtSUS1 was employed to regenerate UDP-glucose during the glucosylation reaction. With this approach, optimal conversion rates can be obtained at limited concentrations of the costly co-factor UDP-glucose. D3G can now be synthesized in sufficient quantity and purity. Similar strategies may be of interest to produce -glucosides of other toxins.},

   abstract = {Glycosylation is an important plant defense mechanism and conjugates of Fusarium mycotoxins often co-occur with their parent compounds in cereal-based food and feed. In case of deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-O-β-D-glucoside (D3G) is the most important masked mycotoxin. The toxicological significance of D3G is not yet fully understood so that it is crucial to obtain this compound in pure and sufficient quantities for toxicological risk assessment and for use as an analytical standard. The aim of this study was the biochemical characterization of a DON-inactivating UDP-glucosyltransferase from rice (OsUGT79) and to investigate its suitability for preparative D3G synthesis. Apparent Michaelis constants (Km) of recombinant OsUGT79 were 0.23 mM DON and 2.2 mM UDP-glucose. Substrate inhibition occurred at DON concentrations above 2 mM (Ki = 24 mM DON), and UDP strongly inhibited the enzyme. Cu2+ and Zn2+ (1 mM) inhibited the enzyme completely. Sucrose synthase AtSUS1 was employed to regenerate UDP-glucose during the glucosylation reaction. With this approach, optimal conversion rates can be obtained at limited concentrations of the costly co-factor UDP-glucose. D3G can now be synthesized in sufficient quantity and purity. Similar strategies may be of interest to produce β-glucosides of other toxins. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Experience learns that conventional pasteurization methods in pest control of foodstuff (hot air, hot water and chemical methods) are not qualitatively and economically efficient. In some cases, these conventional pasteurization methods even turn out to be dangerous for human health. Because of its direct impact on dipoles of dielectric materials, its volumetric heating effect and minimal influence on the food quality, radiofrequency (RF) heating is one of the most promising methods in industrial pest control of foodstuff. In this research, first the temperature rise in the food and pest is studied analytically and is validated numerically using commercial software. These results will be compared with experimental data. Then, as an example of an important agriculture product, wheat flour is tested with RF pasteurization. A 1 kW dielectric heater at variable frequency (13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz and 40.68 MHz) has been designed, and implemented for this experiment. The samples are contaminated by Tribolium confusum flour. The pestiferous wheat flour is heated at 13.56 MHz in 10, 20, 30, 40, 45 and 60 seconds, at 27.12 MHz in 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 60 seconds and at 40.68 MHz in 5, 10, 20, 12, 15 and 60 seconds.},

   abstract = {Three-year field assessment of gene flow from the genetically modified herbicide-resistant spring wheat variety ‘Andros’ to its non-transgenic counterpart has been conducted. A circular field trial design where the wheat plants containing the bar and gfp genes were planted in a central plot, while the recipient non-transgenic plants were grown in eight compass sectors at a distance of 1–5 m from the pollen source, has been developed. Gene flow was analyzed by testing the glufosinate-based herbicide resistance in seedling progeny. The phenotypic and molecular examination of more than 712,000 germinated seeds allowed us to draw a conclusion that the pollen-mediated transgene flow might occur at a low frequency (<0.8 %) even if the nontransgenic wheat was located in the proximity to its transgenic counterpart. The strong asymmetric distribution of gene flow and the maximum outcrossing rate were detected in compass sectors following the direction of the dominant wind. The gene flow rate averaged over all wind direction varied in different years from 0.134 to 0.416 %. The dramatic reduction in transgene flow frequencies was observed while increasing the distance between transgenic and non-transgenic plots. The rise of average gene flow due to significant increase of the transgene pollen area was not confirmed statistically. These results predict that the pollen-mediated transgene flow in spring wheat can be maintained at negligible levels while the existence of a short isolation distance in order to prevent contamination of adjacent non-GM wheat. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {In Iran, wheat is one of the most important sources of diet. Unfortunately, it is vulnerable to contamination with fungi consisting of aflatoxigenic moulds. Since 1997, ozone has been recognized as an effective oxidant and disinfection agent. This study demonstrates the benefits derived from ozone in the inhibition of Aspergillus parasiticus growth and aflatoxin production in wheat. Wheat samples inoculated with A. parasiticus spore suspensions (10,102 and 104 spores/g of wheat) were treated with ozonated water at various concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 2.5 mg ozone/L at different temperatures. Fungal mycelium was weighed to evaluate the effect of ozone on A. parasiticus growth. Moreover, the rate of aflatoxin production was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results indicated that ozonated water can inhibit A. parasiticus growth as well as the accumulation of aflatoxins effectively. The best result was obtained when samples were treated with 2.5 mg/L of ozonated water and at fungal spore concentrations of 10 and 102 for inhibition of fungal growth and aflatoxin production, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the usage of ozonated water during wheat tempering is a promising strategy for inhibition of A. parasiticus growth and for reducing aflatoxin production. Practical Application: The high incidence rate of cereal contamination by mycotoxins has been reported worldwide. Because of the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxins, various methods are used for inhibition of fungal growth and aflatoxin production. In contrast to different methods, which production of unfavorable residues is a problem, ozone decomposes to molecular oxygen rapidly and leaves no unwanted residue. Ozone is a safe, powerful disinfectant that is particularly suited for the food industry because of its ability to control biological growth of unwanted organisms without adding chemical by-products to the food being treated. Our findings indicated that usage of ozonated water instead of water in wheat tempering stage can possibly functioned as a method for inhibition of Aspergillus parasiticus growth and aflatoxins production in wheat and can play an important role in decreasing of cereal wastes and increasing of food safety. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Mean workers exposure to rice husk dust was 5.1±9.6 mg m-3 and the risk of workers exposure to dust was in medium level. 14 of 40 workers have exposure higher than Threshold Limit Value and Occupational Exposure Limit recommended for grain dust. Mean husk rice dust concentrations within the workers' breathing zone among workers in drier worksites in the semi-mechanized operating rice mills was considerably higher than those working in storage and feeding worksites. We found that the risk of the rice husk dust among all rice mill workers was in medium level.

The potential of the waste material on adsorbing heavy metals depends on the affinity, capacity and specificity including physico-chemical nature of it. In the current study the utilization of banana peel as food waste materials due to prospective metal bio-sorption capacity to toxic heavy metal ions: Cadmium and Lead from Oryza Sativa rice from Astaneh Ashrafieh, Gilan province in the north of Iran was investigated. The effect of soaking rinsed rice samples by NaCl and modified banana peel adsorbent by different concentration, pH, contact time and percentage of adsorbent and association of cooking methods on Cadmium and Lead contents were studied. Heavy metal contents in raw, rinsed, soaked by adsorbent and cooked and drained rice samples were determined by Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer. The minimum and maximum Cd and Pb contents in rinsing rice and cooked polished Oryza Sativa rice were 0.002 and 0.041 (mg/kg DW) in Iranian rice variety respectively. It was found that cooking rice by soaking rinsed rice samples by NaCl 2% and Banana peel modified by Citric Acid 0.5% at least for 1 hours had the greatest effect (significantly affect p<0.001) with regards to lowering Pb and Cd levels in cooked rice. Specifically, it preferentially reduced the Cadmium content by 93.2 % and Lead content by 83.78% from the raw rice, when combined with rinse washing and being soaked by salt for one hour contact time. Our finding shows high potential metal biosorption capacity of dried banana peel. The results of the current study suggest that banana peel waste modified by citric acid 1% can be used beneficially in treating rice containing heavy metal ions. © 2016, Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

BAs were quantified for the first time in the intermediate products and craft beers produced with malted organic Emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) in a small size brewery in order to assess the possible presence of critical control points related to biological hazard in the brewing process. BA levels in beers produced exclusively from malted organic Emmer wheat were between 15.4 and 25.2 mg l–1 in the samples of light beer (Lt) and between 8.9 and 15.3 mg l–1 in double malt beers (DM) ready for consumption (the beers stored for 90 days at 1–2°C). Cadaverine and tyramine were the main BAs in the Lt and DM beers, respectively. Increased concentrations of BAs seemed to be more related to the heat treatment of the processing product during mashing and wort boiling, rather than to the fermentation process. Much lower concentrations were found in finished beers obtained from 50% malted organic Emmer wheat and 50% malted barley (up to 3.2 mg l–1) or from 30% malted Emmer wheat (up to 8.3 mg l–1). Thus, Emmer wheat malt can be a useful alternative to wheat and spelt for the production of beer with a limited content of BA, if the processing technology is kept under control. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Based on interviews with growers, marketers, activists, and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources, this paper describes this policy's emergence and evolution using a global commodity chain approach. Several studies suggest that GE herbicide tolerant rice would yield profits for California growers struggling with rising weed control costs. Instead, GE rice was greeted with scrutiny by the California industry and legislators because Asian export markets had zero-tolerance for GE rice contamination. This paper examines how nature's agency-the "unruly" qualities of agro-ecosystem functions, the movement of wildlife, seeds, and pollen across space-strengthened narratives about risk and industry consensus around zero-tolerance rules for GE rice. In addition to recounting the origins of zero-tolerance demands and containment regulations for California rice, this research explores how calls for food safety and zero-tolerance rules are mobilized as surrogate for wider political economic aims. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) may affect up to 1% of the Western population. It is a disease whose diagnosis has been made mainly in childhood, but now the profile has changed, with one out of five newly diagnosed individuals being over 65 years old. The only treatment for this population is a gluten-free diet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the occurrence of arsenic (As) in gluten-free products, basically those rice-based, intended for celiac adult consumers. The current study demonstrated that these rice-based products contained important contents of total arsenic (t-As) (up to 120 μg kg-1) and inorganic arsenic (i-As) (up to 85.8 μg kg-1). It was estimated that the contents of t-As and i-As in rice used as the main ingredient of these foods were as high as 235 and 198 μg kg-1, respectively. The estimated daily intake of i-As was 0.46 and 0.45 μg kg-1 bw in women and men of 58 and 75 kg of body weight (bw), respectively. These values indicate that a health risk to these consumers cannot be excluded. Finally, legislation is needed to delimit the safety intake by health agencies and to improve the labelling of these special rice-based foods for celiac adult consumers. The label should include information about percentage, geographical origin and cultivar of the rice used; besides and if companies want to clearly prove the safety of their products, the exact content of i-As should also be included. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the villi of the small intestine causing abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, or bad absorption due to gluten intolerance. The only treatment for this disease consists of a lifelong gluten free diet; this is, celiac people cannot consume products containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, but they can use rice and corn. Thus, rice flour is mainly used for the manufacturing of the basic products of this population. Unfortunately, rice can contain high contents of total (t-As) and inorganic (i-As) arsenic. The current study demonstrated that products for celiac children with a high percentage of rice contained high concentrations of arsenic (256 and 128 μg kg-1). The daily intake of i-As ranged from 0.61 to 0.78 μg kg-1 body weight (bw) in children up to 5 y of age; these values were below the maximum value established by the EFSA Panel (8.0 μg kg-1 bw per day), but it should be considered typical of populations with a high exposure to this pollutant. Finally, legislation is needed to improve the labeling of these special rice-based foods for celiac children; label should include information about percentage, geographical origin, and cultivar of the used rice. Practical Application: Companies manufacturing foods for celiac children should be aware that high iAs have been found and ask their rice suppliers to provide them with the safest rice (lowest i-As possible) for manufacturing of these special foods. Besides, manufacturers should include all available information on rice on the labels of their products. © 2013 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

   abstract = {Arsenic (As) contamination is a serious hazard to human health and agriculture. It has emerged as an important threat for rice cultivation mainly in South Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the effect of iron (Fe) supplementation on arsenic (AsV) induced oxidative stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice seedlings treated with AsV for 24 and 48h in presence or absence of 2.5mM Fe after which the root and shoot tissues were harvested for analysis. The results indicate significant (p≤0.05) reduction in root and shoot length/dry biomass. Supplementation of Fe showed improved growth responses under stress as compared to AsV alone. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of roots under AsV treatment for 48h showed major alterations in root structure and integrity, although no noticeable changes were observed in Fe - supplemented seedlings. Significantly high (p≤0.05) accumulation of AsV was observed in root and shoot after 24 and 48h of stress. However, under Fe - supplementation As accumulation in root and shoot were considerably low after 24 and 48h of AsV treatment. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in both root and shoot increased significantly (p≤0.05) after 24 and 48h of AsV treatment. In Fe - supplemented seedlings, the levels of H2O2 and MDA were considerably low as compared to AsV alone. Ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) levels also increased significantly (p≤0.05) under AsV stress as compared to control and Fe-supplemented seedlings. Activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly (p≤0.05) high after 24 and 48h of AsV treatment as compared to Fe-supplemented seedlings. The gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of metallothionein (MT1, MT2) and nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP2;1) genes after 5d of As treatment, while their expressions were repressed under Fe-supplementation. Our results indicate that Fe regulates oxidative stress and promotes growth under As stress. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Moreover, the general public is against the use of synthetic preservatives in foods and the use of natural antimicrobials in foods is a current trend. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a volatile antimicrobial derived from oriental and black mustard. The objective of this work was to evaluate the capacity of gaseous AITC in inhibiting the production of mycotoxins by Aspergillus parasiticus (aflatoxin producer) and Fusarium poae (beauvercin and enniatin producer) in wheat flour. Petri dish lids filled with 2 g of wheat flour were inoculated with 104 conidia/g of A. parasiticus or F. poae and placed in a 1 L mason jar. AITC was added at 0.1, 1 or 10 μL/L in the gaseous phase. Jars were hermetically closed and kept at 23 °C for 30 d. Mycotoxins were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS. Even 0.1 μL/L of AITC was able to produce 6.9-23% reduction of mycotoxin production. In general, synthesis of aflatoxins and beauvericin was more affected than enniatins. The use of AITC at 10 μL/L completely inhibited the production of all mycotoxins for 30 d. AITC at low doses could be added to flour packages in order to inhibit the production of potentially dangerous mycotoxins. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

It consists of multiple bioactive substances, including monacolins, which potentially can be used as a nutraceutical. Monacolin K, which is chemically identical to lovastatin, has been recognized as responsible for the cholesterol-reducing effect of this compound. While the European Food Safety Authority maintains that the use of monacolin K from RYR preparations of at least 10 mg can produce a normal blood cholesterol level, the United States Food and Drug Administration considers monacolin K, due to its similarity with lovastatin, an unapproved drug, and therefore marketing of products that label the monacolin content is prohibited. This mini-review summarizes the benefit of RYR in hyperlipidemia, maintains RYR use as a food, and addresses the importance of regulation regarding RYR and the need for clinical data and clear label information for consumers with reference to a toxin-free, non-augmented, standardized amount of monacolins.},

   abstract = {The search for new gluten-free brewing materials is still in its infancy. Limited studies are opening a new area of brewing and once process conditions are adjusted to accommodate gluten-free raw materials. The production of satisfactory gluten-free beers and products will be more realistic and should lead to a greater variety of products for people with celiac disease. Currently only sorghum, millet, and buckwheat appear to be successful gluten-free beer ingredients, while others have only shown adjunct possibilities. Initial research on sorghum was not to find gluten-free alternatives but was in response to the 1988 ban on importation of barley malt into Nigeria. While acceptable to a large proportion of beer drinkers in Africa, the taste and flavor of sorghum beer may not be acceptable to countries outside this region. Further extensive research work is necessary to develop products that meet the tastes and consumer habits of the industrialized countries. A detailed analysis of the ingredient list of some of those so-called gluten-free beers shows that a small percentage of malt was included in the recipes and this contamination would certainly not be suitable for patients with celiac disease. Results collected so far indicate that buckwheat beer shows the most promise as a gluten-free alternative to sorghum beer. Thorough marketing efforts are needed to increase the knowledge and popularity of these cereals and pseudocereals, as at present only a small percentage of the population is familiar with or consumes these cereals. Successful commercial exploitation of these materials is tightly bound to the aspects reported above. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In 2011, three types of verifications, preliminary survey, main inspection, and emergency survey, revealed that rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 500 Bq/kg (the provisional regulation level until March 2012 in Japan) was identified in the areas north and west of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The internal exposure of an average adult eating rice grown in the area north of the nuclear plant was estimated as 0.05 mSv/year. In 2012, Fukushima Prefecture authorities decided to investigate the radiocesium concentration levels in all rice using custom-made belt conveyor testers. Notably, rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 100 Bq/kg (the new standard since April 2012 in Japan) were detected in only 71 and 28 bags out of the total 10,338,000 in 2012 and 11,001,000 in 2013, respectively. We considered that there were almost no rice exceeding 100 Bq/kg produced in Fukushima Prefecture after 3 years from the nuclear accident, and the safety of Fukushima's rice were ensured because of the investigation of all rice.},

Although maize is known to be highly susceptible to aflatoxin contamination, and a staple in many African countries, there is still lack of methods to mitigate the effects. The effect of lactic acid fermentation on reduction of aflatoxin B1 in Tanzania maize-based gruel (togwa) by four monocultures (Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum), natural fermentation and back-slopping at 30°C for up to 24 h was investigated. Monocultures removed 45-55% of aflatoxin B1 while natural fermentation and back-slopping removed 56% and 68% of aflatoxin B1, respectively. Thus, lactic acid fermentation could be a part of a comprehensive mycotoxicosis prevention strategy in the commonly consumed maize-based gruels. Consumers could benefit from enhanced food safety through consumption of gruel less contaminated with mycotoxins and might also benefit from the probiotic effects of lactic acid bacteria. In the scenario where lactic acid bacteria starter culture access and handling could prove challenging, especially to households and small-scale food processors in developing countries, the use of back-slopping in gruel fermentation might be advocated for in order to reduce aflatoxin B1.},

   abstract = {Low rainfall has been blamed for the recent crop failure in Kongwa district, within Tanzania's Central Zone, when 310 out of a total of 331.2 mm of rainfall were concentrated into the first 4 months (November to February) of the 2008-09 cropping season. In May 2009, farmers in this district, expected yields from early maturing (short/intermediate) varieties of sorghum, such as Macia and Pato that were late planted in January and February, to be less than 250 kg/ha. They complained that late delivery of seed of these varieties had led to the poor yields. Records kept by thirty seven subsistence farmers throughout the cropping season indicated that an average of 62 kg of sorghum grain of both early and late maturing varieties was harvested per household by June 2009. This is sufficient for just 14 day's food supply for an average household comprising three adults, two adolescents (aged 10-18 years) and two children (aged less than 10 years). In addition, each household had accrued financial losses, averaging Tsh64, 527.65 (€33.79) from expenditure on wasted inputs. Furthermore, the high incidence of Covered Kernel Smut in sorghum fields suggested that farmers had been supplied with contaminated seed, while the limited availability of seed of the Striga-resistant sorghum varieties, Hakika and Wahi, had allowed this parasitic weed to flourish in their fields. It was estimated that these two pests could have caused sorghum losses in excess of 50%. Each household that was impoverished by this crop failure will have to raise an average of Tsh436, 070 (€228.36) to cover its grain deficit until June 2010. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. & International Society for Plant Pathology 2010.},

   abstract = {Sorghum malt and dolo quality evaluation criteria and parameters affecting quality were surveyed in six cities in Burkina Faso through questionnaires addressed to malt processors, dolo processors, retailers, and consumers. The major quality criteria for malt quality assessment were perceived to be taste and presence/absence of roots in the malt. Taste, alcohol content, and wort sufficiently cooked were perceived as major criteria for the dolo quality assessment. The major parameters affecting malt quality were perceived to be malt production period, proportions of grain and the amount of water entering malting, presence of pesticide residues in the malting grains, and age of grain. Processing method, yeast source, proportions of the components (crushed grain, water, mucilage, yeast) entering dolo production, malt quality, wort temperature at time of inoculation, amount of energy available for cooking, wort and sediment boiling time, quality of mucilage, malt with non-sweet taste, presence/absence of roots in the malt, and ease of filtering crushed malt were perceived as major parameters affecting the dolo quality. These results will be used in the improvement of the dolo supply chain in Burkina Faso by providing more reliable information for training programs for efficient dolo brewing processes, development of best cropping practices to improve grain quality, and providing better selection criteria for sorghum breeding programs. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Molecular methods have revealed more than 18 cryptic species, of which several have been characterized as potential mycotoxin producers. Others are defined as benign relative to their ability to produce mycotoxins. However, these characterizations are based on in vitro culture and toxins production. Several can produce the ochratoxins that are toxic to livestock, poultry, and humans. The black aspergilli produce rots of grapes, maize, and numerous other fruits and grain and they are generally viewed as post-harvest pathogens. Data are review to suggest that black aspergilli, as so many others, are symptomless endophytes. These fungi and their mycotoxins contaminate several major grains, foodstuffs, and products made from them such as wine, and coffee. Evidence is presented that the black aspergilli are producers of other classes of mycotoxins such as the fumonisins, which are known carcinogenic and known prior investigations as being produced by the Fusarium species. Three species are identified in U.S. maize and peanuts as symptomless endophytes, which suggests the potential for concern as pathogens and as food safety hazards. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Buckwheat is a pseudocereal (an eudicot with seed qualities and uses similar to those of monocot cereals, family Poaceae) that is consumed in some Asian countries as a staple, and in some western countries as a health food. Allergic reactions to buckwheat are common in some countries. The objective was to develop a specific and sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect traces of buckwheat that might inadvertently contaminate other foods in order to assure accurate labeling and consumer protection. Buckwheat-specific antibodies produced in 3 species of animals were tested for specificity and titer by direct ELISA and immunoblot. A sandwich ELISA was developed utilizing pooled rabbit antibuckwheat sera to capture buckwheat proteins and pooled goat antibuckwheat sera, followed by enzyme-labeled rabbit antigoat immunoglobulin G (IgG), to detect bound buckwheat proteins. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sandwich ELISA was 2 parts per million (ppm) of buckwheat in the presence of complex food matrices. The ELISA is highly specific with no cross-reactivity to any of 80 food ingredients and matrices tested. Validation studies conducted with buckwheat processed into noodles and muffins showed greater than 90% and 60% recovery, respectively. The percent recovery of buckwheat from noodles was similar to that achieved with a commercial buckwheat ELISA kit (ELISA Systems Pty. Ltd., Windsor, Queensland, Australia) at high buckwheat concentrations. However, the sensitivity of this ELISA was greater than the commercial ELISA. This newly developed ELISA is sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect buckwheat residues in processed foods to protect buckwheat-allergic subjects from potential harm. © 2010 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

A total of 240 rice samples from two harvesting periods were collected in June/July 2012 (period I) and in December 2012/January 2013 (period II) and analyzed for AFB(1) by HPLC with fluorescence detection (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.093 ng/g). Exposure assessment was based on AFB(1) levels in rice and food intake data for rice according to Thai National Consumption. Frequency and levels of AFB(1) were higher in period I (59 %, < LOD = 26.61 mu g kg(-1)) than in period II (10 %, < LOD = 3.51 mu g kg(-1)). Only one sample exceeded the Thai standard limit for total aflatoxin of 20 mu g kg(-1), but 12 out of 240 rice samples exceeded the European Union maximum level for AFB(1) of 2 mu g kg(-1). The data showed that the quality and safety of Thai rice largely comply with the requirement for both exports and domestic consumption. According to the Thai National Consumption data, the estimated AFB(1) intake via rice consumption in period I and period II was 0.80 and 0.12 mu g kg(-1) bw day(-1), respectively. The potential risk for cancer, based on the recommendation of the JECFA, was estimated to be 0.011 person/year/100,000 people at a mean consumption. Although the risk via consumption of Thai rice seems to be low, the maximum levels of AFB(1) in this staple food suggest that careful monitoring and surveillance of AFB(1) contamination in rice is essential to ensure the safety of rice.},

   abstract = {European intake estimates indicate that the presence of HT-2 and T-2 toxins in cereals, mainly in oats, can be of concern for human health. Therefore, the development of sensitive, rapid and reliable methods for determining these mycotoxins in cereals, in particular oats, has high priority. A rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatographic (UPLC) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of HT-2 and T-2 toxins in oats and wheat at μg kg -1 level. Ground samples were extracted with methanol/water (90:10, v/v) and the diluted extracts were cleaned up through immunoaffinity columns. HT-2 and T-2 toxins were separated and quantified by UPLC with photodiode array (PDA) detector (λ = 202 nm) in less than 5 min. Mean recoveries from blank oats samples spiked with HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels of 50-1000 μg kg -1 ranged from 87 to 96%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 7%; mean recoveries from wheat spiked with HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels of 25-100 μg kg -1 ranged from 91 to 103%, with RSDs lower than 5%. The limit of detection of the method was 8 μg kg -1 for both toxins (signal-to-noise ratio 3:1). The method was successfully applied to the analysis of HT-2 and T-2 toxins in naturally contaminated oats and wheat samples. A good correlation was found by comparative analysis of naturally contaminated samples of oats (r = 0.9985) and wheat (r = 0.9058) using the proposed method or a reliable HPLC method with fluorescence detection after pre-column derivatization with 1-anthroylnitrile. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {[Objective]Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metal elements to growth and development of plants and human health. WRKY transcription factors play important regulatory roles in the resistance against stresses. But so far, the regulatory functions of WRKY proteins (WRKYs) in the resistant responses to Cd stress in plants remain unclear so far. [Methods]Full-length coding sequence of OsWRKY15 was amplified by RT-PCR with gene-specific primers designed according to gene prediction. Structural characteristics of OsWRKY15 were analyzed by bioinformatics software; Organ-specific and induced expression patterns of OsWRKY15 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Transcriptional activation activity of OsWRKY15 was tested by yeast one-hybrid assay.[Results]OsWRKY15, 988 bp in length, contained an entire ORF in length of 825 bp, encoding a protein of 274 amino acid residues consisting of one WRKY domain with a zinc finger motif of C2HC, belonging to the WRKY subgroup III. OsWRKY15 had a nuclear localization signal and was predicted to be localized in nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that OsWRKY15 had transcriptional activation activity. The transcript levels of OsWRKY15 were higher in roots than those in stems and leaves, and the least was in panicles, flowers and dry seeds. Its expression was rapidly and significantly induced in response to Cd exposure, nitric oxide (NO) and abscisic acid (ABA) application with more increase folds in roots than in leaves. However, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene exerted no obvious effects on the expression of OsWRKY15. [Conclusion]OsWRKY15 may be involved in the regulation of rice resistance response to Cd stress through NO- and ABA-dependent signal pathways. © Chinese Journal of Rice Science.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are produced by fungi as secondary metabolites. They often multi-contaminate food and feed commodities posing a health risk to humans and animals. A fast and easy to apply multiplex screening of these commodities could be useful to detect multi-contamination. For this, we developed a semi-quantitative 6-plex immunoassay using a suspension array of paramagnetic colour-coded microspheres combined with imaging planar array detection for the mycotoxins aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, T2-toxin, HT-2 toxin and fumonisin B1. Mycotoxin specific monoclonal antibodies were coupled to different sets of microspheres and mycotoxins conjugated to the fluorescent protein R-phycoerythrin served as reporter molecules. Competition between free mycotoxins in the sample and mixed reporter molecules for antibody binding sites on mixed microspheres created a multiplex direct inhibition immunoassay. The reagents were selected for no or low cross-interactions between the assays and cross-reactions with metabolites and possible masked forms were determined. A within-laboratory validation was carried out using blank and spiked barley samples. Furthermore, the 6-plex was used to screen available barley, and malted barley, reference materials. The validation showed very high inter and intra-day precision for all samples with a maximum relative standard deviation value of 10%. The screening assay allows easy and rapid multiplex detection of the target mycotoxins in barley according to EU legislation. With a cut off factor of 50%, based on the EU maximum levels, we were able to screen at 2 μg kg−1 for aflatoxin B1, 2.5 μg kg−1 for ochratoxin A, 625 μg kg−1 for deoxynivalenol, 50 μg kg−1 for zearalenone, 1000 μg kg−1 for fumonisin B1 and 25 μg kg−1 for T-2 toxin. Thanks to the transportable planar array system, the developed 6-plex has potential for future on-site testing. Future implementation of this method as a pre-screening tool, prior to instrumental analysis, is highly attractive since costly LC-MS/MS analysis of samples below the maximum levels can be avoided. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

   abstract = {A combined (triplex) immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of three mycotoxins in grains was developed with superparamagnetic colour-encoded microbeads, in combination with two bead-dedicated flow cytometers. Monoclonal antibodies were coupled to the beads, and the amounts of bound mycotoxins were inversely related to the amounts of bound fluorescent labelled mycotoxins (inhibition immunoassay format). The selected monoclonal antibodies were tested for their target mycotoxins and for cross-reactivity with relevant metabolites and masked mycotoxins. In the triplex format, low levels of cross-interactions between the assays occurred at irrelevant high levels only. All three assays were influenced by the sample matrix of cereal extracts to some extent, and matrix-matched calibrations are recommended for quantitative screening purposes. In a preliminary in-house validation, the triplex assay was found to be reproducible, sensitive and sufficiently accurate for the quantitative screening at ML level. The triplex assay was critically compared to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using reference materials and fortified blank material. Results for the quantification of ochratoxin A and zearalenone were in good agreement. However, the fumonisin assay was, due to overestimation, only suitable for qualitative judgements. Both flow cytometer platforms (Luminex 100 and FLEXMAP 3D) performed similar with respect to sensitivity with the advantages of a higher sample throughput and response range of the FLEXMAP 3D and lower cost of the Luminex 100.

Despite being abundant generalist predators in agricultural fields, spiders (Araneae) have often been overlooked in the context of Bt crop risk assessment. Spiders and their prey were collected from transgenic corn fields expressing lepidopteran-specific Cry1Ab, coleopteran-specific Cry3Bb1, both proteins, and a non-transgenic near isoline. Spiders and prey were screened for Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 using qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spiders from the three most common functional guilds, wandering sheet-tangle weavers, orb-weavers, and ground runners, tested positive for Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 proteins, with the highest per cent positive (8.0% and 8.3%) during and after anthesis. Laboratory feeding trials revealed that Bt-endotoxins were detectable in the Pardosa sp. (Lycosidae)-immature cricket-Bt corn pathway, but not in the Tennesseellum formica (Linyphiidae)-Collembola-Bt corn pathway. Additionally, direct consumption of transgenic corn pollen by Pardosa sp., T. formica, and Cyclosa turbinata (Araneidae) resulted in transfer of both Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 endotoxins. This study demonstrates that Bt-endotoxins are taken up by diverse members of a spider community via pollen and prey consumption and should be factored into future risk assessment. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The complete elimination of fungi-contaminated commodities may not be indeed achievable, but a reduction in these is essential for final product quality as well as for consumer health. For this reason, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the ozone (O3) treatment in Fusarium species and, in addition, to investigate the effect of O3 in malting barley seed germination. The O3 gas was applied to pilot cylinders, divided into control, without O3 gas application, and treated groups, with concentrations of 40 and 60 mg/kg. These were exposed for 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. The species that demonstrated the greatest reduction after the O3 treatment was Fusarium poae, represented by 93.3%, followed by Fusarium graminearum, with 92.6%.

In particular, maize (Zea mays L.) infection caused by Fusarium and the consequent fumonisin contamination is widespread in several countries such as Italy. We developed six maize populations differing in their constitution of regulatory genes able to accumulate respectively anthocyanins in the aleurone layer (r1 gene), pericarp (b1 and pl1 genes) and phlobaphene in the pericarp (p1 gene). These coloured populations, with the related control colourless populations were analysed for mycotoxin content in the kernels during three field seasons with the aim of understanding if there were any correlations with their ability to accumulate flavonoids in kernel tissues. Our results indicate that accumulation of flavonoid pigments in the seeds, in particular phlobaphenes, is able to reduce the level of fumonisin B1. This finding could be used to minimize kernel mycotoxin contamination in this crop, in particular, the development of sweet, pop and polenta coloured corn varieties will help the farmer to keep the level of fumonisin under the threshold of contamination established for human corn consumption. © 2010 Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan.},

Although the new assays were not as sensitive as the commercial qualitative assays, they proved to be more specific. Moreover, the cross-reactivity study indicated contamination of some of the food products used with either hazelnut or soy, which presents a risk for the allergic consumer. The assays were able to quantify as few as 5-15 genome copies. This unit, used to express analytical results for allergen detection by means of PCR, needs to be converted to a unit expressing the amount of allergenic ingredient in order to be informative.

   abstract = {Rice husk (RH), an agricultural waste, is abundantly available in,rice producing countries like China, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, US, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and South East Asia. Despite the massive amount of annual production worldwide, so far RHs have been recycled only for low-value applications. In recent years, many rice mills in rice producing countries have started using RH for the energy production for mill operations as well as household lighting in rural regions. Burning of RHs produces the rice husk ash (RHA). The disposal in landfills or open fields can be problematic and may cause a serious environmental and human health related problems due to the low bulk density of RHA. Several ways are being thought of for disposing RHA by making its commercial use. The amorphous silica forms the main component (83-90%) of RHA. The amorphous silica rich RHA has wide range of applications. High-value applications and current research investigations such as the use of RHA in manufacturing of silica gels, silicon chip, synthesis of activated carbon and silica, production of light weight construction materials and insulation, catalysts, zeolites, ingredients for lithium ion batteries, graphene energy storage/capacitor, carbon capture, and in drug delivery vehicles are presented. Use of RHA in potential future applications is also discussed. It is suggested that the amorphous silica rich RHA could become a potential resource of low cost precursor for the production of value-added silica based materials for practical applications.

   abstract = {The efficacy of vapor-phase (VP) upland rice vinegar (URV) was investigated as a bio-fumigant for maize, to reduce consumer health risks associated with spore and toxin formation by Aspergillus flavus. Complete reduction of mycelial growth occurred with in vitro VP exposure to URV (containing 0.0017 mmol/L acetic acid) or with VP exposure to pure acetic acid (PAA) (containing 0.0023 mmol/L acetic acid). No significant differences were observed between the two materials after 90 min exposures. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), URV vapor was shown to contain volatiles having antifungal activities. These are identified as isoamylalcohol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-, acetate and β-phenylethyl acetate. It is suggested these volatiles increase the antifungal effectiveness of URV. Exposure to VP-URV (containing 0.0043 mmol/L AA) for 5 h completely eliminated viable spores of A. flavus on maize seeds (23% moisture content) previously inoculated with 4.43 ± 0.28 log spores/g). At the same time, aflatoxin production decreased, as VP-URV exposure increased. Hence, VP-URV is shown to be an effective control agent for A. flavus mycelial growth and aflatoxin formation on maize, so effectively reducing the potential for consumer health risks due to this widespread fungus. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Free asparagine plays a central role in nitrogen storage and transport in many plant species due to its relatively high ratio of nitrogen to carbon. However, it is also a precursor for acrylamide, a Class 2a carcinogen that forms during high-temperature processing and cooking. The concentration of free asparagine was shown to increase by approximately 70% in rye grain in response to severe sulfur deficiency (F-test, p = 0.004), while the concentration of both free asparagine and free glutamine increased (by almost threefold and approximately 62%, respectively) in response to nitrogen application (F-test, p < 0.001 for free asparagine; p = 0.004 for free glutamine). There were also effects of nutrient supply on other free amino acids: The concentration of free proline, for example, showed a significant (F-test, p = 0.019) effect of nitrogen interacting with sulfur, with the highest concentration occurring when the plants were deprived of both nitrogen and sulfur. Polymerase chain reaction products for several genes involved in asparagine metabolism and its regulation were amplified from rye grain cDNA. These genes were asparagine synthetase-1 (ScASN1), glutamine synthetase- 1 (ScGS1), potassium-dependent asparaginase (ScASP), aspartate kinase (ScASK), and general control non-derepressible-2 (ScGCN2). The expression of these genes and of a previously described sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 gene (ScSnRK1) was analyzed in flag leaf and developing grain in response to nitrogen and sulfur supply, revealing a significant (F-test, p < 0.05) effect of nitrogen supply on ScGS1 expression in the grain at 21 days post-anthesis. There was also evidence of an effect of sulfur deficiency on ScASN1 gene expression. However, although this effect was large (almost 10-fold) it was only marginally statistically significant (F-test, 0.05 < p < 0.10). The study reinforced the conclusion that nutrient availability can have a profound impact on the concentrations of different free amino acids, something that is often overlooked by plant physiologists but which has important implications for flavor, color, and aroma development during cooking and processing, as well as the production of undesirable contaminants such as acrylamide. © 2016 Postles, Curtis, Powers, Elmore, Mottram and Halford.},

The study assessed the impact of certain potential insecticides used in the rice ecosystem on the miridbug predator and brown planthopper through contact toxicity. Eleven insecticides, including neonicotinoids, diamides, azomethine pyridines, carbamates, pyrethroids, organophosphates and cyclodienes were selected to test their toxicities against the nymphs of C. lividipennis and N. lugens. Median lethal concentration (LC50) was determined for each insecticide using an insecticide-coated vial (scintillation) residue bioassay, which revealed BPMC as the highly toxic chemical with an LC50 of 0.003mga.iL-1 followed by ethofenprox and clothianidin with LC50 of 0.006mga.iL-1 at 48 HAT against C. lividipennis and ethofenprox as the highly toxic chemical with an LC50 of 0.009mga.iL-1 followed by clothianidin with an LC50 of 0.211mga.iL-1 at 48h after treatment (HAT) against N. lugens. Among the insecticides tested, the cyclodiene compound, endosulfan had the lowest acute contact toxicity (LC50=66.65mga.iL-1 at 48 HAT) to C. lividipennis. Among the insecticides tested, endosulfan, chlorpyriphos, acephate and methyl parathion are regarded as safer to C. lividipennis based on selectivity ratio, hazard quotient and probit substitution method of risk assessments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The combined approach of padlock probe ligation and multiplex microarray detection can identify possible admixtures. One undesired 'contaminant' for Farro della Garfagnana is common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), containing the BBAuAuDD genome.

These cereal, fruit, vegetable, and plant-based products provide the basis for many processed consumer products. For cereal and nutraceuticals, which are dry sample products, a modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) method has been used with additional steps to allow wetting of the dry sample matrix and subsequent cleanup using dispersive or cartridge format SPE to reduce matrix effects. More processed foods may have lower pesticide concentrations but higher co-extracts that can lead to signal suppression or enhancement with MS detection. For complex matrixes, GC/MS/MS or LC/electrospray ionization (positive or negative ion)-MS/MS is more frequently used. The extraction and cleanup methods vary with different sample types particularly for cereal-based products, and these different approaches are discussed in this review.

Contamination of maize with aflatoxin poses a serious threat to human health in addition to reducing the crop value leading to a substantial economic loss. Here we report designing a tachyplesin1-derived synthetic peptide AGM182 and testing its antifungal activity both in vitro and in planta. In vitro studies showed a five-fold increase in antifungal activity of AGM182 (vs. tachyplesin1) against A. flavus. Transgenic maize plants expressing AGM182 under maize Ubiquitin-1 promoter were produced through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. PCR products confirmed integration of the AGM182 gene, while RT-PCR of maize RNA confirmed the presence of AGM182 transcripts. Maize kernel screening assay using a highly aflatoxigenic A. flavus strain (AF70) showed up to 72% reduction in fungal growth in the transgenic AGM182 seeds compared to isogenic negative control seeds. Reduced fungal growth in the AGM182 transgenic seeds resulted in a significant reduction in aflatoxin levels (76–98%). The results presented here show the power of computational and synthetic biology to rationally design and synthesize an antimicrobial peptide against A. flavus that is effective in reducing fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination in an economically important food and feed crop such as maize. © 2018},

We showed that farmers had moderate levels of perceived susceptibility to, severity of, benefits of, and barriers to using agrochemicals safely. The major risk factors related to agrochemical exposure resulted from the misuse of pesticides, including erroneous beliefs of farmers regarding pesticide toxicity, the use of faulty spraying equipment, the lack of proper maintenance of spraying equipment, or the lack of protective gear and appropriate clothing.

Consequently, wheat starch is not preferred for many applications as compared to other high paste viscosity starches. Increasing the viscosity of wheat starch is expected to increase the functionality of a range of wheat flour-based products in which the texture is an important aspect of consumer acceptance (e.g., pasta, and instant and yellow alkaline noodles). To understand the molecular basis of starch viscosity, we have undertaken a comprehensive structural and rheological analysis of starches from a genetically diverse set of wheat genotypes, which revealed significant variation in starch traits including starch granule protein content, starch-associated lipid content and composition, phosphate content, and the structures of the amylose and amylopectin fractions. Statistical analysis highlighted the association between amylopectin chains of 18-25 glucose residues and starch pasting properties. Principal component analysis also identified an association between monoesterified phosphate and starch pasting properties in wheat despite the low starch-phosphate level in wheat as compared to tuber starches. We also found a strong negative correlation between the phosphate ester content and the starch content in flour. Previously observed associations between internal starch granule fatty acids and the swelling peak time and pasting temperature have been confirmed. This study has highlighted a range of parameters associated with increased starch viscosity that could be used in prebreeding/breeding programs to modify wheat starch pasting properties. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {In Asia, direct-seeded rice (DSR) is becoming popular as an alternative to puddled transplanted rice (PTR) due to its potential to save scarce resources (labor, water, and energy), reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil physical properties, and increase yields in rotational crops. However, weed management in DSR is more difficult because the initial size differential between weeds and rice is small, reducing crop competitiveness and limiting opportunities for selective control measures including flooding. In this context, preventive approaches-those which focus primarily on limiting dispersal and persistence of weed propagules-may play a critical role in complementing the current reliance on curative tactics such as herbicides. Greater understanding and integration of preventive approaches in DSR may reduce the risks of herbicide resistance development, limit adverse effects of herbicides on human health and the environment, and lower the overall weed management costs. However, information on preventive weed management in DSR is relatively limited. Therefore, the central objectives of this review are to: (i) summarize existing knowledge regarding preventive strategies; (ii) discuss key integrated preventive weed management approaches that have the greatest potential for practical application in DSR systems; and (iii) identify knowledge gaps that limit our ability to optimize preventive approaches. Based on an extensive review of existing literature, we conclude that (i) Minimizing weed seed production in the field is critically important for managing weed seedbanks in DSR, but that given seed dispersal in both time and space, prevention of seed production from neighboring bunds, rice-fallow land and irrigation channels bordering DSR areas may be equally important; (ii) Minimizing dispersal of weed seeds into DSR fields may be a practical approach for species that are dispersed primarily by humans (e.g., as contaminants in crop seeds or through irrigation canals), but not for species that are dispersed primarily by other means (wind and birds); (iii) Promotion of seed predation may be a useful strategy in managing certain weed species in DSR-especially where zero-tillage is used-but more research is needed on the identity of seed predators and management factors that promote their activity; (iv) available evidence suggests that the potential for promotion of seed decay is limited in scope but may be valuable for the management of certain relatively nonpersistent weeds in some cropping systems; (v) strategies that stimulate fatal germination of weed seeds (e.g., stale seedbed) appear to be one of the most promising means of prevention in DSR, but increased information on the mechanisms and timing of dormancy release for key species is needed to optimize and enhance the value of this approach; (vi) Prevention of weed germination and emergence in DSR through mulching-especially in zero-till systems-has proven benefits, but its widespread applicability is limited by the economic tradeoffs associated with using mulch as a source of livestock feed; and (vii) development of anaerobic germination (AG)-tolerant rice cultivars and complementary flooding strategies which can tolerate anaerobic conditions/ flooding hold great potential for the suppression of weeds in DSR. Successful integration of preventive approaches for managing weeds in DSR will depend on the development of multidisciplinary approaches which are biologically effective, economically feasible, and socially acceptable. Preventive weed control measures alone are unlikely to be sufficient for the effective and economical management of weeds in DSR systems, but their integration with curative approaches should reduce weed management costs and increase both the likelihood of adoption of DSR and the realization of its benefits for food security.},

In addition to pollen, nectar and dust, guttated water of seed-dressed plants might be a new source of contamination to bees. Our experiments demonstrated that guttated water of plants germinated from seeds dressed with neonicotinoids contains neonicotinoids. Maize seeds treated with clothianidin (PonchoA (R) 0.5 mg/seed and PonchoA (R) Pro 1.25 mg/seed) resulted in neonicotinoid concentrations up to 8,000 ng mL(-1) in the guttated fluid. This concentration decreases rapidly, but remained detectable over several weeks. Seeds treated with PonchoA (R) Pro did not result in higher concentrations in guttated droplets in the first stages of plant development, but the concentration decreased more slowly. Triticale seed treated with imidacloprid contained small quantities of this active agent (up to 13 ng mL(-1)) in the guttated fluid the following spring after overwintering. During the sampling of guttation fluid, no bees were observed collecting these droplets from triticale or maize. To evaluate the attractiveness of guttation fluid exuded from seed-treated plants under field conditions, more studies are required.},

   abstract = {The present research was undertaken to explore the influence of dried cassava bagasse (F), carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) and tara gum on the quality characteristics of composite wheat bread. F was used to replace wheat flour at 5 and 10% substitution levels. Dried cassava bagasse-enriched wheat breads with CMC and CMC/tara gum binary blend (50:50 w/w) were analyzed to determine the specific volume of the breads, the crumb color, firmness and hardness. The addition of F decreased the specific volume of the breads. As the F concentration increased, the bread lightness decreased and the crumb redness, yellowness, firmness and hardness increased. The CMC was suitable for controlling the staling of the dried cassava bagasse-enriched wheat bread. Samples containing the CMC and F at a 5% wheat flour replacement level had high acceptability by the consumers at the end of storage and resulted in higher crumb moisture content and lower crumb firmness during the storage. Practical Application: Cassava bagasse (CB) is the main solid residue produced by the cassava starch industry and is made up of fibrous root material. The high moisture content prevents the use of CB by the starch industry because there is a strong possibility of microbial contamination. In this sense, drying that is simultaneous with production is essential for the effective utilization of CB. However, alternative uses for this product are necessary in order for the drying process to be economically interesting. One alternative is to use dried cassava bagasse (F) in breadmaking. The addition of F to bread has not been investigated. Hence, more studies are necessary for a better understanding of the effect of a partial substitution of wheat with F to obtain fiber-wheat composite bread. Moreover, it is also necessary to increase dietary fiber intake, taking into account the fact that customers demand healthier foods. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Contamination and development of spoilage filamentous fungi can result in loss of cereal-based food products and it is a critical safety concern due to their potential ability to produce mycotoxins. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) have been proposed as green strategy for the control of the moulds in the food industry due to their ability to produce antifungal metabolites. In this work, eighty-eight Lactobacillus plantarum strains were screened for their antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium culmorum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Cladosporium spp. The overlayed method was used for a preliminary discrimination of the strains as no, mild and strong inhibitors. L. plantarum isolates that displayed broad antifungal spectrum activity were further screened based on the antifungal properties of their cell-free supernatant (CFS). CFSs from L. plantarum UFG 108 and L. plantarum UFG 121, in reason of their antifungal potential, were characterized and analyzed by HPLC. Results indicated that lactic acid was produced at high concentration during the growth phase, suggesting that this metabolic aptitude, associated with the low pH, contributed to explain the highlighted antifungal phenotype. Production of phenyllactic acid was also observed. Finally, a new oat-based beverage was obtained by fermentation with the strongest antifungal strain L. plantarum UFG 121. This product was submitted or not to a thermal stabilization and artificially contaminated with F. culmorum. Samples containing L. plantarum UFG 121 showed the best biopreservative effects, since that no differences were observed in terms of some qualitative features between not or contaminated samples with F. culmorum. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the suitability of LAB strains for the fermentation and antifungal biopreservation of oat-based products. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Throughout history, wheat-based foods have been considered among the safest of all foods produced for human consumption. In part, this claim reflects both the low risk profile of low-moisture foods and the thermal processes used to produce the finished product. Nevertheless, raw flour contains a number of potential hazards, which, if not properly managed, may have the potential to result in serious public health consequences. These hazards are mostly microbiological in origin and arise mainly during production and distribution through the wheat supply chain. The physical processes carried out during milling have minimal impact on the level of contamination present on grain; therefore, the initial microbiological quality of wheat grain has a strong influence on the ultimate quality and safety of milling end products. Although most flourbased foods are processed and consumed in forms that are less likely to be contaminated with pathogens, refrigerated dough products have the potential to be a safety hazard to consumer health because they could be consumed raw or undercooked. The risk for exposure to pathogenic microorganisms present in raw flour by eating uncooked baking mixture has been demonstrated by several outbreaks. Such food safety incidents have led to heightened manufacturer and consumer awareness about safety related to flour-containing foods. © 2016 AACC International, Inc.},

   abstract = {Reducing microbial contamination in wheat is desirable to ensure consumer safety. In this study, the efficacy of adding organic acids and NaCl to tempering water to reduce microbial contamination in hard wheat was evaluated. Hard red winter wheat was tempered to 15.5% moisture by adding sterile distilled water (control) or tempering solutions containing organic acids (acetic, citric, lactic, or propionic; 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 v/v), NaCl (26 or 52% w/v), or a combination of organic acid (acetic or lactic; 2.5 and 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (26 or 52% w/v). After tempering, the microbial load was significantly reduced by all the acid and NaCl treatments when compared with the control. Wheat tempered with 5% acetic, propionic, and lactic acids resulted in reductions of 1.7, 2.3, and 3.8 log colony forming units (CFU) per gram in aerobic plate count (APC), Enterobacteriaceae (Eb), and mold counts, respectively. The combination lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl (52%) was the most effective against APC and Eb, with an average reduction of 4.3 and 4.7 log CFU/g, respectively. Tempering wheat with organic acids and saline solutions may provide milled products with improved microbiological quality when compared with the traditional tempering process using water. © 2016 AACC International, Inc.},

Arsenic naturally occurs in paddy soil and can be increased by irrigating with As-rich groundwater, which may have subsequent impact on rice grains. There have been many studies on As concentration in rice. Some studies have revealed that As concentration in rice depends on the As content in irrigated groundwater and soil, whereas others have shown that various other factors control As solubility, bioavailability and uptake in the soil-rhizosphere-plant system. This review discusses the major factors controlling As behavior in the soil-rhizosphere-plant system and the current status of As contamination in paddy rice from different parts of the world.

   abstract = {Growing rice on arsenic (As)-contaminated soil or irrigating with As-contaminated water leads to significant accumulation of As in grains. Moreover, rice accumulates more As into grains than other cereal crops. Thus, rice consumption has been identified as a major route of human exposure to As in many countries. Inorganic As species are carcinogenic and could pose a considerable health risk to humans even at low dietary concentration. Genotypic variation and concentration of nutrients such as iron, manganese, phosphate, sulfur and silicon are the two main factors that affect As accumulation in rice grains. Therefore, in addition to better growth and yield of plants, application of specific nutrients in optimum quantities offers an added benefit of decreasing As content in rice grains. These nutrient elements influence speciation of As in rhizosphere, compete with As for root uptake and interfere with As translocations to the shoot and ultimately accumulation in grains. This papers critically appraises the methods, forms and rate of application, mechanisms and extent of efficiency of different mineral nutrients in decreasing As accumulation in rice grains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {We examined the chronic toxicity of three rice paddy herbicides (simetryn, mefenacet, and thiobencarb) using an amphibian (Silurana tropicalis) metamorphosis assay (a 28-day semistatic test under an individual-separated exposure system). Each herbicide was tested at two concentrations (1/100 and 1/10 of the 96-h LC50 value reported previously) with morphometric, gravimetric, and thyroid-histological endpoints. Simetryn caused significant retardation in growth and development at both test concentrations (0.04 and 0.40. mg/L), as indicated by significantly shorter total body lengths and hind limb lengths, smaller wet body masses, and delayed developmental stages compared to those observed in the control tadpoles. However, no clear histopathology was observed in the thyroid glands of the tadpoles exposed to simetryn. These results suggest that simetryn can act as a chemical stressor retarding tadpole growth and development without disrupting thyroid functions, even at 1/100 of the 96-h LC50 value. In addition, scoliosis near the tail base was observed in the tadpoles exposed to 0.40. mg/L of simetryn at a significantly high incidence (7/30=23.3%). Therefore, simetryn can also act as a teratogen inducing axial malformations at 1/10 of the 96-h LC50 value. During the 28 days of exposure, neither mefenacet (0.03 and 0.30 mg/L) nor thiobencarb (0.008 and 0.080 mg/L) induced any abnormalities, although the test concentrations measured immediately before the solution renewals decreased to nearly 50 percent of the nominal concentrations since day 14. Because the concentrations tested for simetryn are likely to occur in paddy water, wild anuran tadpoles in paddy water may therefore be adversely impacted by simetryn. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Fusarium species are worldwide causal agents of ear rot in cereals. Their toxigenic potential is a health risk for both humans and animals. In Argentina, most identification of these fungi has been based on morphological and cross-fertility criteria which are time consuming and require considerable expertise in Fusarium taxonomy and physiology. DNA based approaches have been reported as rapid, sensitive and specific alternatives to identify the main fumonisin and trichothecene-producing Fusarium species. In this work, we used PCR assays and the partial sequence of TEF1-alpha gene (Translation Elongation Factor-1 alpha) to identify the fumonisin and trichothecene-producing species in Fusarium isolates from diverse regions of Argentina. The relative efficiency and reliability of those methods to improve mycotoxin risk prediction in this country were also assessed. Species-specific PCR assays were targeted toward multicopy IGS (Intergenic Spacer of rDNA units) and on the toxin biosynthetic genes FUM1 (fumonisins) and TRI13 and TRI7 genes (trichothecenes). PCR assays based on FUM1 gene and IGS sequences allowed detection and discrimination of the fumonisin producers Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium verticillioides. Molecular identification of nonfumonisin producers from Gibberella fujikuroi species complex was possible after determination of TEF1-alpha gene sequences, which indicated the presence of Fusarium subglutinans, Fusarium andiyazi and Fusarium thapsinum. TEF-1 alpha gene sequences also allowed discrimination of the different species of the Fusarium graminearum complex (F. graminearum sensu lato) as F. graminearum sensu strict, Fusarium meridionale and Fusarium boothii. The last two species belonged to NIV chemotype and were detected for the first time in the subtropical region of Argentina while F. graminearum sensu stricto was DON producer only, which was also confirmed by specific PCR assays based on TRI137/TRI7 genes. Our results indicated that the PCR assays evaluated in this work are reliable diagnostic tools to detect the main toxigenic Fusarium species associated to cereal grains in Argentina. An extensive epidemiological survey based on the approach presented in this work is currently in progress to know the mycotoxigenic hazard of Fusarium species in cereal grains from the subtropical region of Argentina.

   abstract = {Aspergillus parasiticus is one of the most important aflatoxin-producing species that contaminates foodstuffs and beverages for human consumption. In this work, a specific and highly sensitive PCR protocol was developed to detect A. parasiticus using primers designed on the multicopy internal transcribed region of the rDNA unit (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA). The assay proved to be highly specific for A. parasiticus when tested on a wide range of related and other fungal species commonly found in commodities, and allowing discrimination from the closely related A. flavus. Accuracy of detection and quantification by conventional PCR were tested with genomic DNA obtained from wheat flour artificially contaminated with spore suspensions of known concentrations. Spore concentrations equal or higher than 106 spore/g could be detected by the assay directly without prior incubation of the samples. The assay described is suitable for incorporation in routine analyses at critical points of the food chain within HACCP strategies.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are important mycotoxins that represent a serious risk for human and animal health. These mycotoxins are mainly produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, two closely related species with different array of aflatoxins. In this work, two specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were developed to detect and quantify both species in wheat flour using primers based on the multicopy ITS2 rDNA target sequence. The species specificity of the assays was tested in a wide range of strains of these species and others colonizing the same commodities. The sensitivity of the assay was estimated in 2.5 pg/reaction in both species. Discrimination capacity for detection and relative quantification of A. flavus and A. parasiticus DNA were analyzed using samples with DNA mixtures containing also other fungal species at different ratios. Both qPCR assays could detect spore concentrations equal or higher than 10(6) spores/g in flour samples without prior incubation. These assays are valuable tools to improve diagnosis at an early stage and in all critical control points of food chain integrated in HACCP strategies. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Coregulation as a form of risk management relies upon a government-private partnership in regulation using governmentbacked codes of practice or action plans. In Texas, implementation of coregulation to manage aflatoxin risk has been practiced since 2011 and operates under the program title One Sample Strategy (OSS). Aflatoxin-contaminated cereals and oilseeds that contain greater than 20 μg/kg of the toxin (B1, B2, G1, and G2) are adulterated as defined by the Texas Commercial Feed Rules and regulated by the Texas Feed and Fertilizer Control Service of the Office of the Texas State Chemist. The present study was intended to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the coregulation program for 3 years based on selected evaluation criteria aiming to improve aflatoxin risk management and thus reduce market and food safety risk in Texas. In 2013, 124 analysts qualified to participate in the program at 23 grain elevators. During the 2013 harvest, use of control samples to ensure testing accuracy revealed that the average relative standard deviation among all participants was 14.5%. In 2014 and 2015, 129 and 151 analysts, respectively, qualified to measure aflatoxin, and the average relative standard deviation values for the working control across the 29 and 30 participating firms were 16.2 and 13.7%, respectively. All firms demonstrated the capability to grind maize to the OSS-prescribed particle size (70% passing through a 20-mesh sieve) in all 3 years. The Texas Feed and Fertilizer Control Service verified testing accuracy of OSS participants analyzing 612, 693, and 482 retained samples in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Results were plotted in an operating curve to depict type I and type II errors. The implementation of the OSS built upon a quality system-based code of practice successfully managed aflatoxin risk in Texas by using coregulation as a governance option. © 2018, International Association for Food Protection.},

Results: Since no clean-up procedure of the sample was required, the sampling step and the subsequent mass spectrometric detection of the aflatoxin B1 was completed in less than 5 min. The limit of detection of aflatoxin B1 is at the sub-ppb level. The results obtained by DEP-MS/MS were also validated by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Recovery of aflatoxin B1 in the sample was evaluated by analyzing spiked aflatoxin B1 with LC/MS/MS to be 85% and DEP-MS/MS to be 84%.

   abstract = {Background: Current arsenic regulations focus on drinking water without due consideration for dietary uptake and thus seem incoherent with respect to the risks arising from rice consumption. Existing arsenic guidelines are a cost-benefit compromise and, as such, they should be periodically re-evaluated. Discussion. Literature data was used to compare arsenic exposure from rice consumption relative to exposure arising from drinking water. Standard risk assessment paradigms show that arsenic regulations for drinking water should target a maximum concentration of nearly zero to prevent excessive lung and bladder cancer risks (among others). A feasibility threshold of 3 μg As l-1 was determined, but a cost-benefit analysis concluded that it would be too expensive to target a threshold below 10 μg As l-1. Data from the literature was used to compare exposure to arsenic from rice and rice product consumption relative to drinking water consumption. The exposure to arsenic from rice consumption can easily be equivalent to or greater than drinking water exposure that already exceeds standard risks and is based on feasibility and cost-benefit compromises. It must also be emphasized that many may disagree with the implications for their own health given the abnormally high cancer odds expected at the cost-benefit arsenic threshold. Summary. Tighter drinking water quality criteria should be implemented to properly protect people from excessive cancer risks. Food safety regulations must be put in place to prevent higher concentrations of arsenic in various drinks than those allowed in drinking water. Arsenic concentrations in rice should be regulated so as to roughly equate the risks and exposure levels observed from drinking water. © 2014 Sauvé; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of ozone (O3) gas treatment on the degradation of residual bifenthrin and pirimiphos-methyl insecticides commonly used in storage wheat grains, as well as to evaluate degradation of their by-products. The residues of bifenthrin decreased after 180 min of exposure in a concentration of 60 μmol/mol (a 37.5 ± 7.4% reduction) with 20% moisture content and 0.9 water activity. On the other hand, under the same experimental conditions, the pirimiphos-methyl residues significantly decreased in the wheat grains (71.1 ± 8.6%) after 30 min of exposure. After O3 gas treatment, three by-products of pirimiphos-methyl (m/z = 306.1) containing different molecular mass to charge ratios (m/z = 278.1, 301.1 and 319.2) were identified by LC-MS. O3 is a strong oxidizer that has shown the potential to reduce pesticide residues in stored grain in order to ensure food quality and safety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are a potential health threat in cereals including wheat. In the European Union (EU), mycotoxin maximum levels are laid down for cereal raw materials and final food products. For wheat and wheat-based products, the EU maximum levels apply to deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, aflatoxins, and ochratoxin A. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the different mycotoxins and their legal limits and on how processing of wheat can affect such contaminants, from raw material to highly processed final products, based on relevant scientific studies published in the literature. The potential compliance with EU maximum levels is discussed. Of the four mycotoxins regulated in wheat-based foods in the EU, most data are available for DON, whereas aflatoxins were rarely studied in the processing of wheat. Furthermore, available data on the effect of processing are outlined for mycotoxins not regulated by EU law—including modified and emerging mycotoxins—and which cover DON derivatives (DON-3-glucoside, mono-acetyl-DONs, norDONs, deepoxy-DON), nivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, enniatins, beauvericin, moniliformin, and fumonisins. The processing steps addressed in this review cover primary processing (premilling and milling operations) and secondary processing procedures (such as fermentation and thermal treatments). A special focus is on the production of baked goods, and processing factors for DON in wheat bread production were estimated. For wheat milling products derived from the endosperm and for white bread, compliance with legal requirements seems to be mostly achievable when applying good practices. In the case of wholemeal products, bran-enriched products, or high-cereal low-moisture bakery products, this appears to be challenging and improved technology and/or selection of high-quality raw materials would be required. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®},

   abstract = {As a result of the rapidly growing global population and limited agricultural area, sufficient supply of cereals for food and animal feed has become increasingly challenging. Consequently, it is essential to reduce pre- and post-harvest crop losses. Extensive research, featuring several physical treatments, has been conducted to improve cereal post-harvest preservation, leading to increased food safety and sustainability. Various pests can lead to post-harvest losses and grain quality deterioration. Microbial spoilage due to filamentous fungi and bacteria is one of the main reasons for post-harvest crop losses and mycotoxins can induce additional consumer health hazards. In particular, physical treatments have gained popularity making chemical additives unnecessary. Therefore, this review focuses on recent advances in physical treatments with potential applications for microbial post-harvest decontamination of cereals. The treatments discussed in this article were evaluated for their ability to inhibit spoilage microorganisms and degrade mycotoxins without compromising the grain quality. All treatments evaluated in this review have the potential to inhibit grain spoilage microorganisms. However, each method has some drawbacks, making industrial application difficult. Even under optimal processing conditions, it is unlikely that cereals can be decontaminated of all naturally occurring spoilage organisms with a single treatment. Therefore, future research should aim for the development of a combination of treatments to harness their synergistic properties and avoid grain quality deterioration. For the degradation of mycotoxins the same conclusion can be drawn. In addition, future research must investigate the fate of degraded toxins, to assess the toxicity of their respective degradation products.},

   abstract = {Toxicity-guided fractionation was used to identify DNA strand breaking impact compounds in extracts obtained from rice heavily infested with the Alternaria alternata strains DSM 62006 and DSM 62010. The major genotoxic potential measured in the comet assay using human colon carcinoma cells (HT29) could be attributed to three unknown peaks, whereas the fractions containing alternariol, its monomethylether or tenuazonic acid showed no significant DNA damaging effects. According to 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, one genotoxic impact compound was identified as Altertoxin II (ATXII). ATXII showed potent DNA damaging properties in HT29 cells with substantial induction of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites. However, no effect was observed with respect to the cellular redox status, measured in the DCF assay and as total glutathione. The induction of apoptosis could be excluded as a potential reason for enhanced DNA damage. After 24 h of incubation with 1 lM ATX II, a significant increase of cells in the G0/G1 phase was observed together with an inhibition of cell proliferation in the sulforhodamine B assay. Taken together, ATX II was found to contribute substantially to the genotoxic effects of complex extracts obtained from Alternaria alternata infested rice. The results demonstrate the high genotoxic potency of ATX II in human cells, underlining the necessity for further studies on the occurrence in food and its relevance for food safety. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

   abstract = {The cereal food chain covers events from the sowing of the seed until the point of ingestion of a food by the consumer. Mycotoxins may develop prior to harvest or through inadequate storage. Most mycotoxins are inherently stable natural chemicals but cleaning, milling and different methods of processing can change their concentrations. Legislation is necessary to protect the consumer so it is important to consider, among other things, the relationship between concentrations of mycotoxins in the raw grains and those in the product purchased by the consumer, especially where different limits are specified at successive stages in manufacture. Recent studies of the fate of fusarium mycotoxins in the cereal food chain carried out alongside industry in the UK have examined changes in the concentrations of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin and zearalenone in wheat, maize and oats and the fumonisin mycotoxins in maize at key stages in the cereal chain. For example, fumonisin concentrations in maize grits after milling were reduced by about 75% compared with the raw maize, but remained similar to the maize in the flour and were increased (x3 to x5) in the bran and meal. Maize flour and grits were then processed into a range of food products such as breakfast cereals, cornflakes, extruded snack products and tortillas and the changes in concentrations were established. Simple extrusion of flour or grits reduced fumonisins by a further 30-70% depending on the process. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were found to be more stable than fumonisins during most processes.},

To minimise consumer exposure to mycotoxins, the levels of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON) in cereals/cereal products and fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in maize are controlled by European Union legislation. Relatively few studies, however, have examined the loss of Fusarium mycotoxins during processing. The behaviour of FB1, FB2 and fumonisin B3 (FB3), DON and ZON during extrusion of naturally contaminated maize flour and maize grits is examined using pilot-scale equipment. DON and ZON are relatively stable during extrusion cooking but the fumonisins are lost to varying degrees. There is some loss of ZON when present in low concentrations and extruded at higher moisture contents. The presence of additives, such as reducing sugars and sodium chloride, can also affect mycotoxin levels. Moisture content of the cereal feed during extrusion is important and has a greater effect than temperature, particularly on the loss of fumonisins at the lower moistures. The effects are complex and not easy to explain, although more energy input to the extruder is required for drier materials. However, on the basis of these studies, the relationship between the concentration of Fusarium toxins in the raw and finished product is toxin- and process-dependent.},

Factors examined were temperature and moisture content. Concentrations of the three mycotoxins were little changed by extrusion although the amount of deoxynivalenol decreased at the lowest moisture content. However, this effect did not appear to be temperature-dependent, suggesting that the apparent loss is either due to binding or inability to extract the residue.

Quantitation},
   abstract = {A novel, specific and sensitive non-immunological liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based assay has been developed to detect and quantify trace levels of wheat gluten in food and consumer products. Detection and quantification of dietary gluten is important, because gluten is a principle trigger of a variety of immune diseases including food allergies and intolerances. One such disease, celiac sprue, can cause intestinal inflammation and enteropathy in patients who are exposed to dietary gluten. At present, immunochemistry is the leading analytical method for gluten detection in food. Consequently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), such as the sandwich or competitive type assays, are the only commercially available methods to ensure that food and consumer products are accurately labeled as gluten-free. The availability of a comprehensive, fast and economic alternative to the immunological ELISA may also facilitate research towards the development of new drugs, therapies and food processing technologies to aid patients with gluten intolerances and for gluten-free labeling and certification purposes. LC-MS is an effective and efficient analytical technique for the study of cereal grain proteins and to quantify trace levels of targeted dietary gluten peptides in complex matrices. Initial efforts in this area afforded the unambiguous identification and structural characterization of six unique physiologically relevant wheat gluten peptides. This paper describes the development and optimization of an LC-MS/MS method that attempts to provide the best possible accuracy and sensitivity for the quantitative detection of trace levels of these six peptides in various food and consumer products. The overall performance of this method was evaluated using native cereal grains. Experimental results demonstrated that this method is capable of detecting and quantifying select target peptides in food over a range from 10pg/mg to 100ng/mg (corresponding to approximately 0.01-100ppm). Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the six target peptides were determined to range from 1 to 30pg/mg and 10-100pg/mg respectively. Reproducibility of the assay was demonstrated by evaluation of calibration data as well as data collected from the analysis of quality control standards over a period of four consecutive days. The average coefficient of determination (R2) for each peptide was consistently found to be &gt;0.995 with residuals ranging from approximately 80% to 110%. Spike recovery data for each peptide in various matrices was evaluated at a concentration level near the approximate LOQ for each, as well as at higher concentration levels (30 and 60ng/mg). The average range of accuracy of detection for all peptides at the lower concentration level was determined to be 90% (±11), while accuracy at the 30 and 60ng/mg levels was 98% (±5%) and 98% (±3%), respectively. The usefulness and capabilities of this method are presented in a practical application to prospectively screen a variety of common commercially available (native and processed) gluten-containing and gluten-free foods and products. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In spite of being an important issue, few studies concerning differences between inorganic arsenic in rice grains under organic and conventional methods of cultivation are available in Brazil, which is an important producer and consumer. In the present work, samples of polished and husked rice (organic and conventional) and gastronomic rice (Arborio, Carnaroli and red/black rice) were analyzed and the results compared to FAO/Codex maximum limits. The total determination and speciation analysis of arsenic were carried out by ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS, respectively. The results showed no significant statistical differences in total As concentration in organic rice (157.7 ± 56.1 ng g− 1) vs. conventional rice (137.4 ± 46.6 ng g− 1) and also in organic husked rice (227.7 ± 95.5 ng g− 1) vs. conventional husked (217.7 ± 60.9 ng g-1). However, inorganic As was 45% higher in organic polished rice than in conventional polished rice and 41% higher in organic husked rice than in conventional husked rice. Gastronomic rice presented total arsenic ranging from 65.4 to 348 ng g− 1 for black and Arborio rice, respectively. Regarding the maximum levels adopted by Codex for i-As (200 ng g− 1), no violation was found. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. Methods: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of .1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh.Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. Results: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. Conclusion: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease. © 2011 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.},

   abstract = {Rice is a staple food for over half the global population and its sustainable production is directly linked to global food security. Rice yield and human health are threatened by arsenic (As) contamination in rice grain. Arsenic enters rice mainly because the geochemical parameters under which rice is conventionally grown mobilize soil As, and because three of the four predominant As species are taken up by rice roots along the efficient silicon (Si) transport pathway. Several strategies have been explored to decrease toxic As uptake by rice including water management, plant breeding and genetic approaches, and Si management. Water management is effective at decreasing As uptake by rice and decreases methane (CH4) emissions, but may decrease rice yield and increase grain cadmium (Cd) content and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Plant breeding or genetic approaches aim to select for or engineer cultivars that limit grain As. Si management aims to increase plant-available Si to compete with As for root uptake. Addition of Si improves rice yield, particularly when plants are stressed with As. Si also affects As speciation, both in the porewater and in the plant, Fe plaque mineral composition and quantity, and greenhouse gas emissions, although performance is amendment specific. More research is needed to mechanistically understand the diverse interactions between Si and As in sorption, porewater chemistry, microbial processes, plant uptake of As, and grain accumulation and speciation of As. Because of the plethora of beneficial effects of Si, Si holds tremendous promise as a sustainable soil amendment in the effort to mitigate rice accumulation of As.},

Results: The effect of system solvents and different types of brans employed for the precise quantification of antioxidant properties showed that for various types of bran enriched porridge; methanol gave the highest yield of total phenolic content followed by acetone and hexane under both extraction methods. The level of supplementation of brans increased the total phenolic content of porridge significantly (P<0.05). Methanolic extracts of all cereal bran enriched porridge showed the highest values for percent inhibition of DPPH-RSA. With the ABTS method (TEAC), wheat bran enriched methanolic extracts showed the highest values (up to 8.88 TERmole/g). Conclusion: Bran enriched porridge showed high phenolic content having high antioxidant activity, which could be serve a potential ingredient for consumer health.

   abstract = {Maize is one of the most important food crops in the world and, together with rice and wheat, provides at least 30% of the food calories to more than 4.5 billion people in 94 developing countries. In parts of Africa and Mesoamerica, maize alone contributes over 20% of food calories. Maize is also a key ingredient in animal feed and is used extensively in industrial products, including the production of biofuels. Increasing demand and production shortfalls in global maize supplies have worsened market volatility and contributed to surging global maize prices. Climatic variability and change, and the consequent rise in abiotic and biotic stresses, further confound the problem. Unless concerted and vigorous measures are taken to address these challenges and accelerate yield growth, the outcome will be hunger and food insecurity for millions of poor consumers. We review the research challenges of ensuring global food security in maize, particularly in the context of climate change. The paper summarizes the importance of maize for food, nutrition and livelihood security and details the historical productivity of maize, consumption patterns and future trends. We show how crop breeding to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses will play a key role in meeting future maize demand. Attention needs to be directed at the generation of high yielding, stress-tolerant and widely-adapted maize varieties through judicious combination of conventional and molecular breeding approaches. The use of improved germplasm per se will not, however, be enough to raise yields and enhance adaptation to climate change, and will need to be complemented by improved crop and agronomic practices. Faced with emasculated state extension provision and imperfect markets, new extension approaches and institutional innovations are required that enhance farmers' access to information, seeds, other inputs, finance and output markets. Over the long-term, large public and private sector investment and sustained political commitment and policy support for technology generation and delivery are needed to overcome hunger, raise the incomes of smallholder farmers and meet the challenges of growing demand for maize at the global level.},

Aflatoxin contamination is considered one of the most serious food safety issues worldwide. To secure the safety of food, regular monitoring of the levels of aflatoxins in foods and feeds is necessary. An alternative could be the detection of the aflatoxin-producing fungi in foods and feeds. In this study a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for rapid, specific and sensitive detection of A. flavus in maize kernels. A. flavus-specific primers based on the O-methyltransferase gene (omt-A) that is involved in the aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis, were designed and used to detect the fungus by PCR. The designed primers were highly specific to A. flavus. The molecular detection sensitivity of A. flavus was 1 ng of purified fungal DNA template in conventional PCR. A real-time PCR assay was standardized for rapid, specific and sensitive detection of A. flavus in corn kernels by using these primers. The standard curve obtained showed a linear correlation between copy number of the cloned target DNA sequence of A. flavus and Cycle threshold (Ct) values, with R2 of 0.98. These PCR-based assays may be highly useful in food and feed industries and quarantine laboratories for detection of this fungus.},

   abstract = {On the world scale, the European Union has established the most comprehensive regulations for mycotoxins in food and feed. These regulations, which are inter alia expressed in the form of maximum levels, largely affect cereal traders. To ensure the safety of their products and compliance with EU legislation traders are required to quantify the mycotoxin levels in their lots. However, while the analytical approaches of research and enforcement are well known and frequently reviewed in the scientific and legal literature, little detailed information is available on the mycotoxin management concepts of trade. The present article is intended to close this gap. On the basis of the results of two surveys conducted amongst European cereal traders in the years 2007 and 2009, three key issues in commercial mycotoxin management are outlined and discussed in the context of the current scientific literature. These are: the issue of sampling, the availability and performance of suitable analytical methods as well as issues evolving from variations between regulatory and contractual maximum levels.

   abstract = {The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2), obtained from the grain of wheat (Triticum spp.) by Roquette (France). The beta-amylase is intended to be used in starch processing for production of glucose syrups containing maltose to be used as a food ingredient. Since the presence of residual amounts of total organic solids (TOS) in glucose syrups after filtration and purification during starch processing is negligible, no dietary exposure was calculated. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of wheat, no toxicological tests are required. Wheat is known as a gluten-containing cereal. However, the gluten content of the food enzyme was shown to be below the limit of quantification of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for 'gluten-free' products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of the beta-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Although b-amylase from wheat is described as a potential occupational respiratory allergen, and oral wheat challenges in wheat allergic patients may result in clinical symptoms, the enzyme and the low levels of other wheat proteins will be removed from the final food ingredients through a downstream purification process. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of grain, the manufacturing process, and the compositional and biochemical data provided, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use.

Cereals are a basic element of the human diet and studies have demonstrated that intake of whole cereal grains is associated with reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. Bioactive molecules residing in the grains are attributed for such positive impact on health. Most of the bioactive molecules of cereal residues in their bran portion and hence their bioavailabilities are governed by the processing step. It is well accepted that grain processing followed by polishing has negative impacts on nutritional properties of cereal. Use of cell wall degrading enzymes for mobilization of bioactive molecules in bran layer of grain is opening up a new avenue for grain enrichment. Therefore, the present review focuses on the role of cell wall degrading enzymes in cereal grains processing for making nutrient rich products more palatable and acceptable among consumers.

   abstract = {Intensification of rice-based cropping systems in Asia has substantially increased production of food and associated crop residues. The interval between crops in these systems is often brief, making it attractive for farmers to burn residues in the field to hasten and facilitate tillage for the next crop. Open-air burning causes serious air quality problems affecting human health and safety, and it has been banned by many Asian governments. In this chapter, we evaluate for rice-based cropping systems existing and emerging in-field alternatives to burning residues based on criteria of productivity, profitability, environmental impact, and sustainability. In intensive rice monocropping systems, residue is typically managed under conditions of soil flooding and anaerobic decomposition during the rice crop. In systems, where rice is rotated with an upland (non-flooded) crop, there are two major categories: residue of upland crop managed during flooded rice and rice residue managed during the upland crop. One option during the flooded rice crop is incorporation of residues from the previous rice or upland crop into the soil. Many studies have examined incorporation of crop residue during land preparation for flooded rice. In the vast majority of cases there was no significant increase in yield or profit. Residue decomposition in anaerobic flooded soil substantially increases methane (CH(4)) emission relative to residue removal. Surface retention of residue during rice cropping is challenging to implement because residue must be removed from the field during conventional tillage with soil flooding (i.e., puddling) and then returned. Alternatively, rice must be established without the traditional puddling that has helped sustain its productivity. Mulch is a good option for rice residue management during the upland crop, especially with reduced and no tillage. Mulch can increase yield, water use efficiency, and profitability, while decreasing weed pressure. It can slightly increase nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emission compared with residue incorporation or removal, but N fertilization and water management are typically more important factors controlling NO emission than residue management. Long-term studies of residue removal have indicated that removing residue from continuous rice systems with near continuous soil flooding does not adversely affect soil organic matter (SOM). The use of crop residue as a mulch with reduced or no tillage for upland crops should be promoted in rice-based cropping systems. On the contrary, residues from the crop preceding rice on puddled and flooded soil can be considered for removal for off-field uses.},

   abstract = {Rice-wheat (RW) cropping system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains has played a significant role in the food security of India. However, sustainability of this important cropping system is at risk due to the deterioration of soil health, mounting pressure on natural resources and emerging challenges of climate change. Conservation agriculture involving zero- or minimum-tillage and innovations in crop residue management (CRM) to avoid straw burning should assist in achieving sustainable productivity and allow farmers to reduce nutrient and water inputs, and reduce risk due to climate change. High yields of the irrigated RW system have resulted in production of huge quantities of crop residues (CRs). Burning of rice straw is common in north-western parts of India causing nutrient losses, and serious air quality problems affecting human health and safety. Mulch is a good option for rice residue management during the wheat crop, especially with no tillage. Mulch can increase yield, water use efficiency, and profitability, while decreasing weed pressure. Surplus residue from the previous wheat crop can be incorporated into the paddy fields with no adverse effect on rice yield. Residue decomposition in anaerobic flooded soil substantially increases methane emission relative to residue removal. Long-term studies of the residue recycling have indicated improvements in physical, chemical and biological health of soil. Since CRs contain significant quantities of plant nutrients; their continuous application will have positive effect on fertilizer management in RW system. Other plausible option of CRM lies in utilizing a potion of surplus residue for producing biochar (and co-production of bioenegy) for using as soil amendment to improve soil health, increase nutrient use efficiency and minimize air pollution. In this review authors have discussed current concerns and possible options for with efficient management of CRs in the RW cropping system. © Printed in India.},

   abstract = {Enriching iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) content in rice grains, while minimizing cadmium (Cd) levels, is important for human health and nutrition. Natural genetic variation in rice grain Zn enables Zn-biofortification through conventional breeding, but limited natural Fe variation has led to a need for genetic modification approaches, including over-expressing genes responsible for Fe storage, chelators, and transporters. Generally, Cd uptake and allocation is associated with divalent metal cations (including Fe and Zn) transporters, but the details of this process are still unknown in rice. In addition to genetic variation, metal uptake is sometimes limited by its bioavailability in the soil. The availability of Fe, Zn, and Cd for plant uptake varies widely depending on soil redox potential. The typical practice of flooding rice increases Fe while decreasing Zn and Cd availability. On the other hand, moderate soil drying improves Zn uptake but also increases Cd and decreases Fe uptake. Use of Zn- or Fe-containing fertilizers complements breeding efforts by providing sufficient metals for plant uptake. In addition, the timing of nitrogen fertilization has also been shown to affect metal accumulation in grains.The purpose of this mini-review is to identify knowledge gaps and prioritize strategies for improving the nutritional value and safety of rice.},

   abstract = {The presence of aflatoxins in food and feed products is considered as one of the most important food safety problems in the world. Aflatoxins occur in a wide range of food products and can cause serious health risks. Moreover, they can nowadays only be detected by the use of destructive, time-consuming and expensive chemical analyses. We investigate the use of one- and two-photon induced fluorescence spectroscopy as nondestructive detection methods for the identification of aflatoxins. Particularly, as the samples under test, we consider the aflatoxin-contamination of different maize batches since maize is the staple food in many countries and cultivates in climates that show an extensive presence of the fungi. We first characterize the one- and two-photon induced fluorescence spectrum of pure aflatoxin B1, when excited with 365nm and 730nm laser light respectively. Subsequently, we experimentally investigate the fluorescence spectrum of various healthy and aflatoxin-contaminated maize samples, when excited with 365nm, 405nm, 730nm, 750nm, 780nm and 810nm laser light. For all excitation wavelengths, an intrinsic fluorescence signal of the maize grains is observed. However, for the contaminated maize grains, the present aflatoxin B1 significantly influences the intrinsic fluorescence. Depending on the excitation wavelength, we observe a different spectral contrast between the healthy and contaminated samples. The largest optical difference is observed for excitation with 365nm and 780nm, during the one- and two-photon induced fluorescence measurements respectively. The comparison of the measured fluorescence signals allows us to define a detection criterion for the optical identification of the contaminated maize samples. We can conclude that fluorescence spectroscopy can be a valuable tool for the measurement of aflatoxin-contents in maize, paving the way for real-time non-destructive industrial scanning-based detection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To date, deoxynivalenol is mostly detected by sample-based, time-consuming chemical analyses. To obtain a non-destructive detection of deoxynivalenol in unprocessed, solid maize kernels, we investigate UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflection spectroscopy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage spectroscopic measurement procedure, allowing the characterization and identification of deoxynivalenol in ungrounded maize kernels. The first stage focuses on the characterization of the optimum illumination and detection wavelengths, by the measurement of the mean contamination of a collection of maize kernels, using a 250 mm-reflection integrating sphere. The second measurement stage enables an accurate classification of contaminated maize grains, by the measurement of the local contamination on individual kernels, using a 30 mm-reflection integrating sphere. We first characterized and compared the reflection spectra of low (150 ppb) and high (1388 ppb) natural deoxynivalenol-contaminated maize kernels. Moreover, we validated these measurement results by the characterization of a reference deoxynivalenol-contaminated maize powder (1840 ï¿½ 30 ppb). A spectral contrast between the low and high contaminated samples could be observed between 700 nm and 1400 nm. Furthermore, a detection criterion could be defined, allowing us to successfully classify a contaminated maize batch into a high (18184 ppb) and low (654 ppb) contaminated subsample. As a result, this verifies the two-stage measurement approach and illustrates the use of diffuse reflection spectroscopy as a valuable tool for the measurement of deoxynivalenol concentrations in maize, paving the way for real-time non-destructive industrial scanning-based detection. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {During the 20th century, the economic position of oats (Avena sativa L.) decreased strongly in favour of higher yielding crops including winter wheat and maize. Presently, oat represents only ~ 1.3% of the total world grain production, and its production system is fragmented. Nonetheless, current interest is growing because of recent knowledge on its potential benefits in food, feed and agriculture. This perspective will serve as a further impetus, with special focus on the recently valued advantages of oats in human food and health. Five approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims apply to oats. Four relate to the oat-specific soluble fibres, the beta-glucans, and concern the maintenance and reduction of blood cholesterol, better blood glucose balance and increased faecal bulk. The fifth claim concerns the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, especially present in the endosperm, which reduces the risks of heart and vascular diseases. Furthermore, oat starch has a low glycemic index, which is favourable for weight control. Oat-specific polyphenols and avenanthramides have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, oats can contribute significantly to the presently recommended whole-grain diet. Next to globulins, oats contain a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called ‘avenins’ but at a much lower quantity than gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye. Oat avenins do not contain any of the known coeliac disease epitopes from gluten of wheat, barley and rye. Long-term food studies confirm the safety of oats for coeliac disease patients and the positive health effects of oat products in a gluten-free diet. These effects are general and independent of oat varieties. In the EU (since 2009), the USA (since 2013) and Canada (since 2015) oat products may be sold as gluten-free provided that any gluten contamination level is below 20 ppm. Oats are, however, generally not gluten-free when produced in a conventional production chain, because of regular contamination with wheat, barley or rye. Therefore, establishing a separate gluten-free oat production chain requires controlling all steps in the chain; the strict conditions will be discussed. Genomic tools, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker array and a dense genetic map, have recently been developed and will support marker-assisted breeding. In 2015, the Oat Global initiative emerged enabling a world-wide cooperation starting with a data sharing facility on genotypic, metabolic and phenotypic characteristics. Further, the EU project TRAFOON (Traditional Food Networks) facilitated the transfer of knowledge to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to stimulate innovations in oat production, processing, products and marketing, among others with regard to gluten-free. Finally, with focus on counteracting market fragmentation of the global oat market and production chains, interactive innovation strategies between customers (consumers) and companies through co-creation are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper presents reflectivity analysis and performance of alternative organic-based (corn stover) microwave frequency absorbers for use in anechoic chambers.

   abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of rice naturally contaminated with arsenic (As) and the same As-species added as solubilized-salt on the redox state and the As distribution in male mice. The total As amount in the Brazilian polished rice used in this study was 169.81 ± 6.12 ng g−1. Indeed, the concentrations of As species were 40.77 ng g−1 (arsenite, As3+), 65.71 ng g−1 (dimethylarsinic acid, DMA), 11.90 ng g−1 (monomethylarsonic acid, MMA), and 25.96 ng g−1 (arsenate, As5+). In this sense, animals were randomly divided into seven groups with six mice per group: I) control: habitual food; II) rice I: diet containing 10% of rice naturally containing As (4.08 μg As3+/kg diet, 6.57 μg DMA/kg diet, 1.19 μg MMA/kg diet, and 2.60 μg As5+/kg diet); III) rice II: diet containing 20% of rice naturally containing As (8.15 μg As3+/kg diet, 13.14 μg DMA/kg diet, 2.38 μg MMA/kg diet, and 5.19 μg As5+/kg diet); IV) rice III: diet containing 40% of rice naturally containing As (16.31 μg As3+/kg diet, 26.28 μg DMA/kg diet, 4.76 μg MMA/kg diet, and 10.38 μg As5+/kg diet); V) spiked feed I: diet containing As species as solubilized-salt (concentration equivalent to group II); VI) spiked feed II: diet containing As species as solubilized–salt (concentration equivalent to group III); VII) spiked feed III: diet containing As species as solubilized-salt (concentration equivalent to group IV). The time of treatment was 100 days. After euthanasia, it was observed an increase in total As concentration in tissue samples of groups treated with diet containing rice naturally contaminated and diet containing As species. For instance, the highest As concentrations (higher than 330 ng g−1) was observed in the bladder of animals belonging to Rice II and III and spiked feed III groups. Furthermore, it was verified the highest As concentrations in bladder &gt; hair &gt; lung &gt; kidney &gt; liver &gt; blood. We also observed the presence of DMA and As5+ in liver and kidneys. Regarding oxidative stress biomarkers, we observed significant reduction of Glutathione (GSH) concentration in blood of animals belonging to groups IV, V, VI and VII. Besides, the antioxidant enzymes activities, Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-Px), Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), increased significantly in blood of animals belonging to group VII. On the other hand, it was not observed differences in nitric oxide (NO) levels among all the groups used in this study and the control group. Thus, we conclude that some minor effects were found in mice exposed to the diet containing the highest amount of rice naturally contaminated with As species. These findings contribute to evaluate the safety of human dietary consumption. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

   abstract = {Microcystins (MC), representing >100 congeners being produced by cyanobacteria, are a hazard for aquatic species. As MC congeners vary in their toxicity, the congener composition of a bloom primarily dictates the severity of adverse effects and appears primarily to be governed by toxicokinetics, i.e., whether transport of MCs occurs via organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps). Differences in observed MC toxicity in various fish species suggest differential expression of Oatp subtypes leading to varying tissue distribution of the very same MC congener within different species. The objectives of this study were the functional characterization and analysis of the tissue distribution of Oatp subtypes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a surrogate model for cyprinid fish. Zebrafish Oatps (zfOatps) were cloned, and the organ distribution was determined at the mRNA level. zfOatps were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells for functional characterization using the Oatp substrates estrone-3-sulfate, taurocholate and methotrexate and specific MC congeners (MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-LF and MC-LW). Novel zfOatp isoforms were isolated. Among these isoforms, the organ-specific expression of zfOatp1d1 and of members of the zfOatp1f subfamily was identified. At the functional level, zfOatp1d1, zfOatp1f2, zfOatp1f3 and zfOatp1f4 transported at least one of the Oatp substrates, and zfOatp1d1, zfOatp1f2 and zfOatp1f4 were shown to transport MC congeners. MC-LF and MC-LW were generally transported faster than MC-LR and MC-RR. The subtype-specific expression of zfOatp1d1 and of members of the zfOatp1f subfamily as well as differences in the transport of MC congeners could explain the MC congener-dependent differences in toxicity in cyprinids. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this work, we estimated the rate and magnitude of grain and grain transport silo technology contamination by faeces of R. rattus and identified the routes of entry of rodent faeces into grain stored in silos. We also compared the sizes of rat faeces and stored barley grains to determine whether they could easily be separated using sieves. We found that roof rats were able to heavily contaminate grain surfaces and conveyor belts with faecal deposits during a 3-week observation period. The average contamination rate was 6.90 ± 0.92 faeces/m2 (range 0-26 faeces/m2) for grain surfaces and 34.80 ± 8.03 faeces/m2 (range 8-87 faeces/m2) for conveyor belts. The size measurements (length, width and surface area) of rat faeces and barley grains showed their high similarity; these results therefore indicate that the physical separation of the two materials using sieves will be problematic. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Among the Fusarium species causing this disease, Fusarium poae is less often implicated, but is a fungus of increasingly recognized importance and it is associated with human and animal toxicoses. The aim of this study was to examine the responses of wheat and barley varieties to inoculation by different F. poae isolates, in order to observe contamination by this fungus in the grains. The analyses were performed during 2008, 2009, and 2010 under natural conditions at the Facultad de Agronomía de Azul-UNCPBA, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Statistical analyses were carried out and the identities of re-isolated isolates were tested by a primer-specific PCR reaction and by comparing DNA-ISSR amplifications. Differences among varieties in fungal symptoms were significant (p≤0.05) only in 2008. Although the number of re-isolated isolates in wheat was greater than the number of samples with observable symptoms, no significant correlations were found. However, there were correlations in barley and the linear regression analyses allow suggesting that for each grain with visual symptoms, two barley grains could contain the fungus. Thus it can be concluded that the real number of grains contaminated with F. poae is significantly higher than the number with observable disease symptoms, and therefore the real extent of contamination with F. poae is currently underestimated and should be considered for food risk analysis in the near future.},

Methods and Results: A continuous survey of 20 maize silage stacks was conducted over a period from three to 11 months after ensiling. Filamentous fungi, yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated at five time-points, and cultivable species of filamentous fungi were identified. Significant differences in the numbers of filamentous fungi, yeast and LAB were detected. The highest numbers of fungi were five to seven and the lowest 11 months after ensiling, while the LAB decreased in numbers during the study. Filamentous fungi were isolated from all stacks at all time-points. The most abundant toxigenic mould species were Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium paneum and Aspergillus fumigatus. Conclusions: There are significant variations in the microbiology of maize silage over a whole storage season. The risk of fungal spoilage was highest 5-7 months after ensiling and lowest after 11 months. Significance and Impact of the Study: This information is valuable in the assessment of health risks connected with spoiled maize silage and may be useful in the management of maize silage stacks, when whole-season storage is applied. © 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

In the present investigation, a syringe was loaded with sorbent (rice bran) for the separation and enrichment of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc, prior to their analysis by flame atomic absorption spectrometry which was described to substitute the batch and column techniques. The syringe was loaded with 2.0 g of sorbent in order to retain the analyte elements. Six milliliter of sample solution (pH 8.0 ± 0.2) was drawn into the syringe in 15 s and discharged over a period of 15 s. Then, 2.0 M HCl eluent was drawn into the syringe and ejected back to desorb the analyte elements. At the optimum conditions, the percentage recoveries of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn was in the range of 95.5-99.4% with SD of 0.10%. The elements could be concentrated by drawing and discharging several portions of sample successively. The detailed study of various interferences made the confirmation of the method highly selective. The risk of contamination is less than that with the column technique. The method was successfully applied for the determination of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn in spiked and natural water samples.

Different volumes (50-200μL) of L. cubeba, citral or limonene were absorbed into a filter paper and placed inside an oven (18L). Ten brown rice snack bars (2cm wide×4cm long×0.5cm deep) were put in an oven and heated at 180°C for 20min. The shelf-life of the treated snack bars at 30°C was assessed and sensory testing was carried out to investigate their consumer acceptability. A count of total phenolic content (TPC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the properties of essential oil, citral, and limonene before and after the laser treatment was studied for possible modes of action. It was found that the laser treatment improved the antifungal activity of the examined volatile L. cubeba and citral with Aspergillus flavus inhibition by 80% in comparison with those of the control not treated with the laser. L. cubeba vapor at 100μL with the laser treatment was found to completely inhibit the growth of natural molds on the snack bars for at least 25days; however, without essential oil vapor and laser treatment, naturally contaminating mold was observed in 3days. Results from the sensory tests showed that the panelists were unable to detect flavor and aroma differences between essential oil treatment and the control. Laser treatment caused an increase in TPC of citral oil whereas the TPC in limonene showed a decrease after the laser treatment. These situations could result from the changing peak of the aliphatic hydrocarbons that was revealed by the FTIR spectra. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Thai commercial food products that do not contain wheat, rye, barley, or gluten on their labels were surveyed as to whether they were suitable for CD individuals by examining the absence of gluten or the presence of gluten <20 ppm. In Thailand, ELISA tested for gluten content in 129 commercial food products that contained neither wheat, rye, barley, nor gluten on their labels. One hundred nineteen of these 129 products included <20 ppm gluten, and 10 products contained >20 ppm gluten. Surprisingly, four products showed gluten levels >1%. In these 10 products, wheat presence was confirmed by PCR analysis. Our survey suggests that CD individuals can consume most of the examined Thai food products, and the survey showed the potential of these Thai products as new diets for CD patients so as to expand the limited food choices from different food cultures, and ultimately to improve the quality of life for all CD individuals globally. The appropriate gluten management strategies need to be implemented by Thai food manufacturers to ensure accurate labeling and to protect the safety of consumers with CD.},

   abstract = {In this study the occurrence of hidden fumonisin B-1 (FB1) and fumonisin B-2 (FB2) was analysed, on two cereal substrates (maize and rice), inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides (MRC 826), in order to determine the ratio of hidden FB1 and FB2. Two parallel methods were applied: an in vitro human digestion sample pre-treatment and the routine extraction procedure, in both cases with subsequent LC-MS analysis. It was found that all samples showed higher concentration of total fumonisin B-1 after digestion, as compared to that of free fumonisin analysed only after extraction. The percentage of the hidden form by maize was 18.8 % (+/- 2.4) for FB1 and 36.8 % (+/- 3.8) for FB2, while for rice it was 32.3 % (+/- 11.3) and 58.0 (+/- 6.8), respectively, expressed as the proportion to total fumonisin B-1, for the total dataset. Significant differences were found in the FB1 and FB2 concentration measured after the different digestion phases (saliva, gastric and duodenal) in case of both matrixes. The results are useful for human risk assessment, since both humans and animals may be exposed to markedly higher toxin load, as determined merely by conventional analytical methods.},

   abstract = {The present study was performed to evaluate the food safety of TT51-1, a new type of genetically modified rice that expresses the Cry1Ab/Ac protein (Bt toxin) and is highly resistant to most lepidopteran pests. Sixteen male and 16 female cynomolgus monkeys were randomly divided into four groups: conventional rice (non-genetically modified rice, non-GM rice), positive control, 17.5% genetically modified rice (GM rice) and 70% GM rice. Monkeys in the non-GM rice, positive control, and GM rice groups were fed on diets containing 70% non-GM rice, 17.5% GM rice or 70% GM rice, respectively, for 182 days, whereas animals in the positive group were intravenously injected with cyclophosphamide every other day for a total of four injections before the last treatment. Six months of treatment did not yield abnormal observations. Specifically, the following parameters did not significantly differ between the non-GM rice group and GM rice groups: body weight, food consumption, electrocardiogram, hematology, immuno-phenotyping of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, mitogen-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation, splenocyte proliferation, KLH-T cell-dependent antibody response, organ weights and ratios, and histological appearance (p&gt;0.05). Animals from the GM rice group differed from animals in the non-GM rice group (p&lt;0.05) in several parameters: specifically, their body temperatures and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were higher, whereas their levels of serum K+, Cl- and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5) were lower. Because dose- or time-dependent changes were not observed in this study and animals appeared histologically normal, the aforementioned differences were not considered to be adverse or related to the treatment with GM rice. In conclusion, a 6-month feeding study of TT51-1 did not show adverse immunotoxicological effects on cynomolgus monkeys. ï¿½ 2016 Tan et al.

   abstract = {This study examined whether the survival of Vibrio cholerae O1 on contaminated cooked rice was influenced by the type of rice. Vibrios survived unchanged on clumps of glutinous white rice (wet, grains adhered) held at room temperature for 24 h. On nonglutinous white rice (slightly moist, grains separate), 30% viable vibrios remained at 24 h. On nonglutinous brown rice (moist, separate, covered with a mucus-like substance), the number of vibrios increased 2.7-fold at 24 h. Survival rates of vibrios on the surfaces of a row of five cooked rice grains after 2 h of exposure at room temperature were 86, 29, 12, and 4% for glutinous rice, white rice, and the endosperm and pericarp of brown rice, respectively. (Each boiled brown rice grain surface was partly pericarp and partly endosperm, which became exposed by a rupture of the pericarp.) Covering each inoculated grain with a similar cooked rice grain surface increased the corresponding figures to 93, 99, 60, and 94%. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that each type of cooked grain surface possessed a distinct microtopography. For example, the surfaces of glutinous rice grains consisted of separated overlapping strips with many holes, while the pericarps of brown rice were flat interspersed with small pits. In conclusion, each type of boiled rice produced a distinct survival pattern of V. cholerae O1 caused by both the distinct gross features and the fine surface characteristics of the rice. The significance of this finding is that the type of rice consumed can be a factor in cholera transmission by contaminated rice. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection.},

   abstract = {Premixes for medicated feedstuffs are considered to be veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) prepared in advance with a view to the subsequent manufacture of medicated feedstuffs. Medicated feedstuffs should be prepared only from market authorized premixes and premixes for medicated feedstuffs can be used only as prescribed medicines. Apart from active substances, premixes contain carriers which have a role in the homogenization of medicated feedstuffs. Wheat bran as a carrier may be a source of different, potentially harmful or toxic substances e.g. aflatoxin. In our study, 15 different batches of premixes with a wheat bran component were tested for aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The samples tested showed contamination with AFB(1) ranging from 1.5 to 35 ng/g (mean = 18.79 ng/g). However, no correlation between AFB(1) levels and the month of collection or season of production was observed. Considering the composition of the premix, the only possible source of contamination with AFB(1) was wheat bran. Contamination probably occurred before the production of the premix, probably in the field or during storage. Concentrations of active substances and citric acid (a neutralising agent for mycotoxins) were in accordance with the producer's declaration. Our discovery of A FB1 in the tested premixes was in contravention of the definition and primary role of veterinary medicinal products. In this study, we would like to highlight the need for monitoring raw materials of biological origin for premix production. Even though carriers are not pharmacologically active substances, an efficient method for controlling potential contaminants such as mycotoxins or their toxic components should be proposed, with the aim of protecting animal health, consumers, employees and end-users in the production of veterinary medicinal products.},

Antifungal activity of the synthetic HBD-3 was demonstrated against Fusarium culmorum, Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus niger.

Deoxynivalenol (DON), a commonly detected Fusarium mycotoxin, has drawn utmost attention due to high exposure levels and contamination frequency in the food chain. Biological control is emerging as a promising technology for the management of DON contamination. Functional biological control agents (BCAs), which include antagonistic microbes, natural fungicides derived from plants and detoxification enzymes, can be used to control DON contamination at different stages of grain production. In this review, studies regarding different biological agents for DON control in recent years are summarized for the first time. Furthermore, this article highlights the significance of BCAs for controlling DON contamination, as well as the need for more practical and efficient BCAs concerning food safety.},

   abstract = {Irrigation of paddy fields to arsenic (As) containing groundwater leads to As accumulation in rice grains and causes serious health risk to the people worldwide. To reduce As intake via consumption of contaminated rice grain, identification of the mechanisms for As accumulation and detoxification in rice is a prerequisite. Herein, we report involvement of a member of rice NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein) transporter, OsNRAMP1, in As, in addition to cadmium (Cd), accumulation through expression in yeast and Arabidopsis. Expression of OsNRAMP1 in yeast mutant (fet3fet4) rescued iron (Fe) uptake and exhibited enhanced accumulation of As and Cd. Expression of OsNRAMP1 in Arabidopsis provided tolerance with enhanced As and Cd accumulation in root and shoot. Cellular localization revealed that OsNRAMP1 resides on plasma membrane of endodermis and pericycle cells and may assist in xylem loading for root to shoot mobilization. This is the first report demonstrating role of NRAMP in xylem mediated loading and enhanced accumulation of As and Cd in plants. We propose that genetic modification of OsNRAMP1 in rice might be helpful in developing rice with low As and Cd content in grain and minimize the risk of food chain contamination to these toxic metals. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The objective of this study was evaluate the potential of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in inhibit the production of mycotoxins in corn kernels by Aspergillus parasticus, Fusarium tricinctum, Fusarium verticillioides, Alternaria alternata and Gibberela zeae. Kernels were treated with gaseous AITC at 50, 100 or 500 μL/L during 48 h in hermetic flasks. Then, flasks were opened for 24 h and 100 g of corn were inoculated with 105 conidia/g of either fungal species. Flasks were kept at 23 °C for 30 d, and corn was processed for mycotoxins quantification (LC-MS/MS) and AITC residual (LC-DAD). Mycotoxins were produced in all control groups (without AITC), while AITC treatments were able to keep the production of 12 mycotoxins at undetectable levels. AITC penetrated the kernels, and residual doses (∼16%) were detected after 30 d, showing an extended protection period. Gaseous AITC could potentially be used as a prophylactic agent to avoid mycotoxin production in corn. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Aflatoxin production in maize and peanuts remains a major public health problem, especially in developing countries. One promising method for combating aflatoxin formation is biocontrol using competitive exclusion, a management strategy currently being studied in maize crops in Thailand. It is important that the strains of Aspergillus flavus used in biocontrol be non-toxigenic and be incapable of reversion to toxigenicity. In the current study, 80 non-toxigenic strains of A. flavus, randomly selected from commercially produced dried maize samples from several sources in Thailand, were screened for their potential as biocontrol strains by examining the 24 aflatoxin biosynthesis genes, using a PCR assay. Assessment of the presence or absence of PCR products provides an indication of the function of pathway genes. Of the 80 strains, 78 showed no PCR products from one or more genes in the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway. Twenty-three isolates showed only one failure, in the aflD (nor-1) gene, but most isolates failed to produce a PCR product for two or more genes. Nineteen isolates (24%) failed to show a PCR product in 10 or more genes. Altogether, 45 PCR product patterns were observed, usually common to only one or two isolates, indicating great diversity in the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway in A. flavus isolates taken from dried Thai maize. Although the absence of a particular PCR product is not conclusive evidence that the particular gene is non-functional, the absence of several such PCR products provides reasonable evidence that the isolate in question will not revert to toxigenicity in the field.},

This research aims to determine the effects of consuming food rich in glycine on hippuric acid levels in the urine of shoe industry workers exposed to high levels of toluene. This research is an experimental study using certain treatments for the research subjects consisting of workers exposed to toluene at some shoe home-industries. Before working, the workers were examined for hippuric acid level in their urine. The workers were then given food rich in glycine to eat. After three days of consuming food containing glycine, the workers were examined again for hippuric acid level in their urine. The findings of the study showed that the level of toluene in the shoe home-industry A was 511.8 mg/m3 which was three times greater than the standard reference of the normal toluene level recommended by Permenakertrans No.13 of 2011 (168 mg/m3). The results also showed that the mean concentration of hippuric acid in their urine before consuming food rich in glycine was 0.4855 g/L while the mean concentration of hippuric acid in their urine after the intake of food containing glycine was 0.649 g/L. It means that there was an increase of 33.8% in hippuric acid levels secreted in their urine. In conclusion, glycine is effective to detoxify benzoic acid from the body of workers exposed to toluene. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.},

This study was conducted to determine the extent of A. cantonensis infection among rats and snails collected from rice-farming villages of Muñoz, Nueva Ecija. A total of 209 rats, 781 freshwater snails, and 120 terrestrial snails were collected for the study. Heart and lungs of rats and snail tissues were examined and subjected to artificial digestion for parasite collection. Adult worms from rats were identified using SSU rDNA gene. Seven nematode sequences obtained matched A. cantonensis. Results revealed that 31% of the rats examined were positive with A. cantonensis. Rattus norvegicus and R. tanezumi showed prevalence of 46% and 29%, respectively. Furthermore, only Pomacea canaliculata (2%) and Melanoides maculata (1%) were found to be positive for A. cantonensis among the snails collected. Analysis of host distribution showed overlapping habitats of rats and snails as well as residential and agricultural areas indicating risks to public health. This study presents a possible route of human infection for A. cantonensis through handling and consumption of P. canaliculata and M. maculata or crops contaminated by these snails. © 2016 Ma.

We screened maize-containing food and feed products from Turkey to assess the prevalence of GM material. RESULTS: With this aim, 83 food and feed products - none labelled as containing GM material - were screened using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for four common GM elements (35S/NOS/bar/FMV). Of these, 18.2% of feeds and 6% of food samples tested positive for one or more of these elements, and were subjected to event-specific PCR to identify which GM organisms they contained. Most samples were negative for the approved GM events tested, suggesting that they may contain adventitious GM contaminants. One sample was shown to contain an unapproved GM event (MON810, along with GA21) at a concentration well above the statutory labelling requirement. CONCLUSION: Current legislation has restricted the penetration of GM maize into the Turkish food industry but not eliminated it, and the proliferation of different GM events is making monitoring increasingly complex. Our results indicate that labelling requirements are not being followed in some cases. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.},

In this study, the roles of rice bran cysteine protease inhibitors, oryzacystatins, were considered for efficient production of bioactive peptides from RBP. In silico evidence demonstrates that aspartate protease (pepsin at pH > 2) and metalloproteinase (thermolysin) have strong prospects for use in simultaneously cleaving the QXVXGX motif of oryzacystatins, which can lead to their inactivation, and in releasing bioactive sequences from the protease inhibitors. The cleaved bioactive peptides are known to possess activities that can be applied in the management of hypertension, oxidative stress, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other aberrant cellular processes. Moreover, several potentially bioactive di- and tripeptides were identified in oryzacystatin peptide pools. This study provides an important consideration and a direction that can lead to efficient release of bioactive peptides from rice bran proteins for functional food applications. ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, three cereal bars containing white maize, blue maize, or unripe banana flours were prepared. The proximal composition, in vitro starch digestibility and product acceptability were evaluated. The bar prepared with blue maize exhibited the highest level of protein and fat, and that containing white maize the highest dietary fiber and indigestible fraction contents. However, the product prepared with unripe banana flour showed the highest total and rapidly digestible starch levels, while that added with blue maize exhibited greater slowly digestible starch values. No difference in RS content was detected among the three bars. The starch hydrolysis indices and predicted glycemic indices of the three preparations were low (40-54% and 42-54%, respectively). Similar acceptation scores were recorded for the three experimental bars. Cereal bars with variable starch digestibility features and good acceptation by consumers may be prepared following the proper choice of functional ingredients.

In this study, we used healthy prey to expose lacewing larvae to Cry1Ab protein produced by Bt maize, and also determined the concentration of this protein at different trophic levels. Experiments were conducted in which Chrysoperla pudica (Navas) larvae were fed different diets which included aphids and healthy Bt-resistant Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae feeding on Bt maize tissue. Lacewing larval and pupal development times as well as overall mortality were determined. The concentration of Cry1Ab protein in B. fusca larvae were fourfold reduced compared with that in leaf tissue and was below detection level in lacewing larvae. Survival to the pupal stage was higher than 96% in all treatments. Larval and pupal development periods did not differ significantly between treatments in which prey fed on Bt or non-Bt maize. This study showed feeding on healthy prey that consumed Cry1Ab protein has no adverse effect on the biology of C. pudica.},

   abstract = {This article provides an overview of available systems for management of Fusarium mycotoxins in the cereal grain supply chain, with an emphasis on the use of predictive mathematical modeling. From the state of the art, it proposes future developments in modeling and management and their challenges. Mycotoxin contamination in cereal grain-based feed and food products is currently managed and controlled by good agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, hazard analysis critical control points, and by checking and more recently by notification systems and predictive mathematical models. Most of the predictive models for Fusarium mycotoxins in cereal grains focus on deoxynivalenol in wheat and aim to help growers make decisions about the application of fungicides during cultivation. Future developments in managing Fusarium mycotoxins should include the linkage between predictive mathematical models and geographical information systems, resulting into region-specific predictions for mycotoxin occurrence. The envisioned geographically oriented decision support system may incorporate various underlying models for specific users' demands and regions and various related databases to feed the particular models with (geographically oriented) input data. Depending on the user requirements, the system selects the best fitting model and available input information. Future research areas include organizing data management in the cereal grain supply chain, developing predictive models for other stakeholders (taking into account the period up to harvest), other Fusarium mycotoxins, and cereal grain types, and understanding the underlying effects of the regional component in the models.

Basic requirements for such a system were addressed, including the selection of indicators, locating information sources, development of underlying model, and investigation of stakeholders' needs. The selection and ranking of key indicators for identifying emerging mycotoxins was based on a literature review, followed by a structured expert judgment study. The expert study was based on the Delphi technique and used a panel of 43 European experts. The Delphi procedure resulted in a selected set of 12 key indicators for each of three relevant stages of the wheat chain (cultivation; transport and storage; processing). For wheat cultivation, these were: relative humidity/rainfall, crop rotation, temperature, tillage practice, water activity in the kernels, crop variety, harvest conditions, changes in fungal populations, fungicide use, plant health, regional infection pressure and food safety awareness. For the majority of the selected indicators, information sources were identified in specific European countries. However, most sources are not readily accessible and particular data is lacking. A theoretical concept for a model underlying the envisioned emerging mycotoxin identification system has been developed. The model links the key indicators and their information sources to aid and promote identification of emerging mycotoxins. It manages different types of information sources and levels of available information. The needs of various stakeholder groups regarding the system were investigated by means of two empirical elicitation sessions. The results showed that all stakeholders considered that such a system would be beneficial. One major challenge expected in establishing the system is stakeholder commitment to sharing data and information. This requires great efforts in improving communication and interaction between the key stakeholders.},

   abstract = {Climate change will affect the development of cereal crops and the occurrence of mycotoxins in these crops, but so far little research has been done on quantifying the expected effects. The aim of this study was to assess climate change impacts on the occurrence of deoxynivalenol in wheat grown in north-western Europe by 2040, considering the combined effects of shifts in wheat phenology and climate. The study used climate model data for the future period of 2031-2050 relative to the baseline period of 1975-1994. A weather generator was used for generating synthetic series of daily weather data for both the baseline and the future periods. Available models for wheat phenology and prediction of deoxynivalenol concentrations in north-western Europe were used. Both models were run for winter wheat and spring wheat, separately. The results showed that both flowering and full maturation of wheat will be earlier in the season because of climate change effects, about 1 to 2 weeks. Deoxynivalenol contamination was found to increase in most of the study region, with an increase of the original concentrations by up to 3 times. The study results may inform governmental and industrial risk managers to underpin decision-making and planning processes in north-western Europe. On the local level, deoxynivalenol contamination should be closely monitored to pick out wheat batches with excess levels at the right time. Using predictive models on a more local scale could be helpful to assist other monitoring measures to safeguard food safety in the wheat supply chain. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Climate change is expected to aggravate feed and food safety problems of crops; however, quantitative estimates are scarce. This study aimed to estimate impacts of climate change effects on deoxynivalenol contamination of wheat and maize grown in the Netherlands by 2040. Quantitative modelling was applied, considering both direct effects of changing climate on toxin contamination and indirect effects via shifts in crop phenology. Climate change projections for the IPCC A1B emission scenario were used for the scenario period 2031-2050 relative to the baseline period of 1975-1994. Climatic data from two different global and regional climate model combinations were used. A weather generator was applied for downscaling climate data to local conditions. Crop phenology models and prediction models for DON contamination used, each for winter wheat and grain maize. Results showed that flowering and full maturity of both wheat and maize will advance with future climate. Flowering advanced on average 5 and 11 days for wheat, and 7 and 14 days for maize (two climate model combinations). Full maturity was on average 10 and 17 days earlier for wheat, and 19 and 36 days earlier for maize. On the country level, contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol decreased slightly, but not significantly. Variability between regions was large, and individual regions showed a significant increase in deoxynivalenol concentrations. For maize, an overall decrease in deoxynivalenol contamination was projected, which was significant for one climate model combination, but not significant for the other one. In general, results disagree with previous reported expectations of increased feed and food safety hazards under climate change. This study illustrated the relevance of using quantitative models to estimate the impacts of climate change effects on food safety, and of considering both direct and indirect effects when assessing climate change impacts on crops and related food safety hazards.},

   abstract = {Background: The consumption of maize highly contaminated with carcinogenic fumonisins has been linked to high oesophageal cancer rates. The aim of this study was to validate a urinary fumonisin B-1 (UFB1) biomarker as a measure of fumonisin exposure and to investigate the reduction in exposure following a simple and culturally acceptable intervention. Methods: At baseline home-grown maize, maize-based porridge, and first-void urine samples were collected from female participants (n = 22), following their traditional food practices in Centane, South Africa. During intervention the participants were trained to recognize and remove visibly infected kernels, and to wash the remaining kernels. Participants consumed the porridge prepared from the sorted and washed maize on each day of the two-day intervention. Porridge, maize, and urine samples were collected for FB1 analyses. Results: The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) for FB1 exposure based on porridge (dry weight) consumption at baseline and following intervention was 4.84 (2.87-8.14) and 1.87 (1.40-2.51) mg FB1/kg body weight/day, respectively, (62% reduction, P < 0.05). UFB1C, UFB1 normalized for creatinine, was reduced from 470 (295-750) at baseline to 279 (202-386) pg/mg creatinine following intervention (41% reduction, P = 0.06). The UFB1C biomarker was positively correlated with FB1 intake at the individual level (r - 0.4972, P < 0.01). Urinary excretion of FB1 was estimated to be 0.075% (0.054%-0.104%) of the FB1 intake. Conclusion: UFB1 reflects individual FB1 exposure and thus represents a valuable biomarker for future fumonisin risk assessment. Impact: The simple intervention method, hand sorting and washing, could positively impact on food safety and health in communities exposed to fumonisins.

   abstract = {Maize is the predominant food source contaminated by fumonisins and this has particular health risks for communities consuming maize as a staple diet. The main biochemical effect of fumonisins is the inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis causing an increase in sphingoid bases and sphingoid base 1-phosphates and a depletion of the complex sphingolipids, thereby disrupting lipid metabolism and sphingolipid-mediated processes and signalling systems. Attempts to use the elevation of sphinganine as a human biomarker of fumonisin exposure have to date been unsuccessful. Consequently, recent research has focussed on developing a urinary exposure biomarker based on the measurement of the nonmetabolised toxin. In animals, fumonisins are poorly absorbed in the gut and are mostly excreted unmetabolised in faeces, with only a small percentage (0.25-2.0%) in urine. This appears to also be true in humans were fumonisin B1 (FB1) is detectable in urine soon after exposure, but in very small amounts relative to total intake. However, with modern sensitive and selective analytical methods such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, these low levels can be readily determined. The first study to show a positive correlation between consumption of maize and urinary FB 1 was conducted in a Mexican population consuming tortillas as a staple food. Further validation of this relationship was achieved in a South African subsistence farming community with a positive correlation between urinary FB1 and fumonisin exposure, as assessed by food analysis and food intake data. The most recent developments are aimed at measuring multiple mycotoxin biomarkers in urine, including FB1. Current exposure studies in Guatemala are combining the urinary biomarker with measurement of sphinganine-1-phosphate in blood spots as a measure of biochemical effect. Thus, the urinary FB1 biomarker could contribute considerably in assessing the adverse health impact of fumonisin exposure.},

Accurate measurement of mycotoxins is essential for determining the safety of grain and their products for consumption. Four sources of variation were studied, namely sub-sample size, variation within a single maize sub-sample, number of replicates and toxin detection techniques used by independent laboratories. Variation in detected fumonisin levels within a single maize sample was high using the 25 g sub-samples proposed in the Neogen Veratox protocols. A 250 g sub-sample significantly reduced variation in fumonisin levels of samples. An incremental increase in sample size also improved the number of positive samples recorded. Increasing the number of replicates using the recommended sub-sample size (25 g) did notreduce variation except when the sample had high fumonisin levels. Improved accuracy was recorded when a 250 g sub-sample was used in conjunction with increased replicates. Data from laboratory analyses indicated that ELISA reactions (Agricultural Research Council–Grain Crops Institute) correlated significantly with HPLC results of the Medical Research Council (MRC), but neither of these correlated with results from an independent laboratory. Concentrations determined using ELISA were consistently higher than those from the HPLC (MRC) technique. Quantification technique, sample size, replicate number and laboratory where analyses are conducted, appear to be important sources of variation for quantification of fumonisins. © 2011, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Fenitrothion and esfenvalerate were applied so as to produce theoretical concentrations of 10 and 0.5 mg kg-1, respectively. Two hours after treatment, the grains were processed and deposition was analyzed by gas chromatography. Grain species did not influence insecticide stability. This stability was only dependent upon the processing method and insecticide type. Grains processed together with dry ice provided the greatest percentage of recovery for both insecticides. Regardless of the processing method, more esfenvalerate than fenitrothion was recovered, thus demonstrating the greater stability of the pyrethroid during this operation.},

   abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused mainly by a few members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is a major threat to agricultural grain production, food safety, and animal health. The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions. Additional research in this area should be a priority so that breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies can be developed. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

Rice grown on As contaminated areas accumulates higher As in their edible parts. Based on our previous transcriptome data, two rice glutaredoxins (OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1) were identified that showed up-regulated expression during As stress. Here, we report OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 from rice involved in the regulation of intracellular arsenite (AsIII). To elucidate the mechanism of OsGrx mediated As tolerance, both OsGrxs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Δars) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains (Δycf1, Δacr3). The expression of OsGrxs increased As tolerance in E. coli (Δars) mutant strain (up to 4 mM AsV and up to 0.6 mM AsIII). During AsIII exposure, S. cerevisiae (Δacr3) harboring OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 have lower intracellular AsIII accumulation (up to 30.43% and 24.90%, respectively), compared to vector control. Arsenic accumulation in As-sensitive S. cerevisiae mutant (Δycf1) also reduced significantly on exposure to inorganic As. The expression of OsGrxs in yeast maintained intracellular GSH pool and increased extracellular GSH concentration. Purified OsGrxs displays in vitro GSH-disulfide oxidoreductase, glutathione reductase and arsenate reductase activities. Also, both OsGrxs are involved in AsIII extrusion by altering the Fps1 transcripts in yeast and protect the cell by maintaining cellular GSH pool. Thus, our results strongly suggest that OsGrxs play a crucial role in the maintenance of the intracellular GSH pool and redox status of the cell during both AsV and AsIII stress and might be involved in regulating intracellular AsIII levels by modulation of aquaporin expression and functions. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Mixtures of different metals at free ion concentrations, each causing <10% inhibition of root elongation, yielded significant mixture effects, with inhibition reaching up to 50%. The independent action (IA) model predicted mixture toxicity statistically better than the concentration addition (CA) model, but some synergisms relative to the IA model were observed. These synergisms relative to IA were most pronounced in quaternary mixtures and when the dose-response curves had steep slopes. Generally, antagonistic interactions relative to the CA model were observed. Increasing solution Zn concentrations shifted metal interactions (CA based) from additive or slightly synergistic at background Zn concentrations to antagonistic at higher Zn concentrations, suggesting a protective effect of Zn. Overall, the present study shows that the CA model can be used as a conservative model to predict metal mixture toxicity to barley. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:2483-2492. (c) 2016 SETAC},

   abstract = {Biomass burning emissions of rice straw residues may be carried out near urban agglomerations and may present a potential health risk for the population. Thus, tracers of these emissions should be clearly identified. We present a detailed chemical characterisation, including inorganic and organic tracer species, of PM10 aerosol at a rural site located close to the urban agglomeration of Valencia (Eastern Spain) during the rice straw burning season in 2006. Our results show that open burning of rice field residues increased daily PM10 concentrations on a regional scale (approximately 17,400 ha) by 10-15 mu g m(-3) on average, with a maximum of 30 mu g m(-3) on peak episodic days. PM10 levels during open burning events were especially enriched in oxalate, fluoranthene, C-31 n-alkane, levoglucosan, K, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), oleic acid, Cl-, Na, NO3-, and V. High enrichments were also obtained for Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, and Na, probably as a consequence of the bioaccumulation of trace metals in rice straw and the influence of sea spray and brackish waters on the crops. Anthropogenic contributions from lubricant oil residues, probably from agricultural machinery or nearby traffic emissions, were also detected in the levels of n-alkanes (C-19). The high Carbon Preference Index (CPI; >3.5) obtained for n-alkanoic acids confirmed their mostly biogenic origin. Organic tracers were more sensitive than inorganic species to the influence of indirect (regional scale or long-range transported) biomass burning emissions. Source apportionment of the PM10 mass by means of PCA-MLRA showed that rice straw burning reached maximum contributions up to 40% of the PM10 mass during peak episodes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In many rural contexts of the developing world, agricultural residues and the organic fraction of waste are often burned in open-air to clear the lands or just to dispose them. This is a common practice which generates uncontrolled emissions, while wasting a potential energy resource. This is the case of rice husk in the Logone Valley (Chad/Cameroon). In such a context household energy supply is a further critical issue. Modern liquid fuel use is limited and traditional solid fuels (mainly wood) are used for daily cooking in rudimentary devices like 3-stone fires, resulting in low efficiency fuel use, huge health impacts, increasing exploitation stress for the local natural resources. Rice husk may be an alternative fuel to wood for household energy supply. In order to recover such a biomass, the authors are testing a proper stove with an original design. Its lay-out (featuring a metal-net basket to contain the fuel and a chimney to force a natural air draft) allows a mix of combustion/gasification of the biomass occurring in a completely burning fire, appropriate for cooking tasks. According to results obtained with rigorous test protocols (Water Boiling Test), different lay-outs have been designed to improve the performance of the stove. Technical and economic issues have been addressed in the development of such a model; building materials have been chosen in order to guarantee a cost as low as possible, using locally available items. The feasibility of the introduction of the stove in the studied context was assessed through an economic model that keeps into account not only the technology and fuel costs, but also the energy performance. According to the model, the threshold for the trade-off of the stove is the use of rice husk to cover 10-15% of the household energy needs both with traditional fireplaces or with improved efficiency cookstoves. The use of the technology proposed in combination with improved woodstove would provide householders with an appropriate and convenient cooking technology portfolio, increasing the opportunities of choice of the preferred energy system for the user and allowing significant savings for the family budget (up to 50% of the total annual cooking energy expenditure). The proposed model may be used also as a tool for the evaluation of the affordability or for the comparison of different cooking technologies also in other similar contexts, given their specific techno-economic parameter values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether 3-ADON isolates differ in aggressiveness, as measured by the FHB index, and DON production from 15-ADON isolates under field conditions, and (2) whether the performance of resistant host cultivars was stable across isolates. Field tests of all isolates were conducted with three replicates at each of two locations in Canada and Germany in 2008 with three host genotypes differing in FHB resistance level. The resistant host genotype showed resistance regardless of the chemotype or location. The differences between mean FHB indices of 3-ADON and 15-ADON isolates were not significant for any wheat genotype. In contrast, average DON production by the 3-ADON isolates (10.44 mg kg-1) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than for the 15-ADON isolates (6.95 mg kg-1) at three of the four locations where moderately resistant lines were tested, and at both locations where susceptible lines were evaluated. These results indicate that 3-ADON isolates could pose a greater risk to food safety. However, as the mean aggressiveness and DON production of 3-ADON and 15-ADON chemotypes was similar on highly resistant lines, breeding and use of highly resistant lines is still the most effective measure of reducing the risks associated with DON in wheat. © 2010 KNPV.},

In addition, moulds produce mycotoxins that cause illness or even death to consumers. This study evaluated maize and groundnuts from selected districts in Kenya for mycotoxigenic moulds. Both good and mouldy maize and groundnuts were obtained from randomly selected rural households and markets in Trans Nzoia, Kakamega Central and Kuria West districts in Kenya and analysed for moulds using the direct plating method. All the samples were positive for moulds and contained at least one genera of mycotoxigenic fungi; Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium. The major moulds isolated in order of frequency were Aspergillus (91.3%), Penicillium (86.2%) and Fusarium (79.3%). Fifteen species of Aspergillus, eighteen of Fusarium and fifteen of Penicillium were isolated. Most of the samples (86.2%) contained more than two types of moulds. Some of the samples categorized as 'good' based on visual observation were highly contaminated by more species of moulds than samples categorized as mouldy. The highest occurring mould species were A. flavus (56.9%), A. niger (27.6%), A. parasiticus (25.9%), A. ochraceus (24.1%), F. subglutinans (29.3%), F. oxysporum (19%), F. graminearum (17.2%), P. rubrum (41.3%), P. cyclopium (34.5%) and P. rugulosum (22.4%). Seventy five percent of the moulds isolated in this study are known to be mycotoxigenic or produce other harmful compounds. The high occurrence of mycotoxigenic moulds in maize and groundnuts points to the great danger posed to human and animal health from consumption of contaminated grains and their associated mycotoxins. © 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

   abstract = {An intense environmental dispute surrounds the maize-fields of Mexico. Mexican maize traditional varieties (or 'landraces') constitute a global genetic resource that may well be critical to future agricultural development and corn breeding. Many environmentalists, farmers, and consumers in Mexico are therefore concerned that their maize landraces may have been 'contaminated' by imported transgenic maize, grown in the USA. The criticisms of this transgenic technology are complex and call into question the nature of the boundary between political and ecological (i.e. scientific) disputes. Our paper surveys these criticisms, and this political-scientific boundary, in a three-part analysis. First, we turn to Gramsci's notes on science from his eleventh prison notebook to rethink the political ecology of transgenic maize, i.e., the way the ecological analysis of transgenic introgression is treated as politics. Second, we present the multiple criticisms of transgenic maize as scalar phenomena. Third, we review the recent scientific literature on transgene introgression to evaluate recent calls for the 'decontamination' of Mexican maize. Our reading illustrates two dilemmas facing the group that occupies the hegemonic subject-position in this dispute, ecological scientists. First, the popular desire to 'decontaminate' Mexican maize exceeds their capacities (due to complications involved with sampling). Second, although the political debate surrounding 'contaminated' Mexican maize exceeds science, the boundary between the dispute's scientific and parascientific elements cannot be adjudicated scientifically. In other words, the boundary between science and politics is porous. Thus in two respects the dispute is ecological, yet beyond the capacity of this science to resolve. Yet, following Gramsci, these findings should not lead us to see science as mere ideology, or apolitical, or encourage a retreat into metaphysics. Rather it points to the need for a social transformation that sees science as "humanity forging its methods of research ... in other words, culture, the conception of the world." By exploring the dilemmas of decontamination, the dispute over transgene introgression in Mexican maize-fields provides an opportunity to elaborate upon Gramsci's neglected insights into the politics of science.

The selection of 300 sampling locations was completely random. The population was segregated into gender and age categories. A daily consumption questionnaire was used to determine the consumption of corn tortillas and a frequency questionnaire to determine the consumption of other corn products. A book of photographs was used to adjust criteria on the size of the portions of corn products and a probability distribution was built of the weight and content of corn for tortillas. Probability density functions (PDFs) were used to describe the consumption of each corn product. Men and those between 14 and 65 years old have the highest consumption of tortillas. Tortillas, antojitos, tacos and chilaquiles are the products that provide the largest amount of corn to the Veracruz people’s diet. Even though these products are nixtamalisated, there is evidence that after a thermo-alkaline process some contaminants such as mycotoxins (like aflatoxin, which is a mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic toxin) could be present in high concentrations. These results highlight the need to characterise the consumption of one of the main foods included in dietary staple in Mexico as a first step for a probabilistic risk assessment. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) as a carcinogen poses a great threat to food security and public health through plant-derived foods such as rice, the staple for nearly half of the world's population. We have previously reported that overexpression of truncated gene fragments derived from the rice genes OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 could reduce Cd accumulation in transgenic rice. However, we did not test the full length genes due to prior work in Arabidopsis where overexpression of these genes caused seedling lethality. Here, we report on limiting the overexpression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 through the use of the stress- inducible promoter RD29B. However, despite generating 625 putative transformants, only 7 lines survived as T1 seedlings and only 1 line of each overexpressed OsO3L2 or OsO3L3-produced T2 progeny. The T2 homozygotes from these 2 lines showed the same effect of reducing accumulation of Cd in root and shoot as well as in T3 grain. As importantly, the concentrations of essential metals copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were unaffected. Analysis of the expression profile suggested that low Cd accumulation may be due to high expression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 in the root tip region. Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region. It is possible that interaction with histone H2A modifies chromatin to regulate downstream gene expression. © 2018},

   abstract = {Considering the wide existence of mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat and derived products, finding ways to detoxify DON in wheat grains as original resources for food-chain contamination is very important to protect human health and reduce economic losses. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of destroying DON in wheat via ozonation under different conditions, such as moisture content (MC), ozone concentration, exposure time, and form of raw-material. The achieved data showed that DON reduction significantly improved with increased ozone concentration and exposure time. The whole wheat flour (WWF) was easier to degrade than the wheat kernels. Higher MC decreased larger amounts of DON. The maximum reduction of DON was 20.10% for the MC group, compared with the 11.79% and 16.29% for the other MC groups. DON concentration decreased from 3.89 mg/kg to 0.83 mg/kg under the generally recognized Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) level of 1 mg/kg, when WWF was treated with 100 mg/L of ozone treatment for 60 min. The first-order kinetic model established in this work showed a good R-squared value (R2 &gt; 0.877) and was consistent with the results. Therefore, ozonation is an effective and rapid way to degrade DON in wheat, especially in whole wheat flour. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The effect of ozone on deoxynivalenol (DON) detoxification was investigated. Ozone treatment could significantly reduce the levels of DON in wheat; 53% of DON in wheat was decomposed with 90 mg l–1 of ozone at a flow rate of 15 l min–1 for 4 h. The safety of DON-contaminated wheats (DCWs) untreated/treated by ozone was also evaluated. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into a standard diet group and five experimental diet groups for a 51-day orally administration experiment. In the experiment, no remarkable changes in the general appearance of the mice were observed, and all the mice survived until the scheduled necropsy. The results of sub-chronic toxicity indicated that mice fed on DCWs alone had significantly decreased in body weight gain, thymus and spleen weights, ratios of liver, thymus and spleen to body weight, blood indices (red blood cell, haemoglobin, white blood cell), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)), while showing a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Histopathological examination indicate that DON elicited some degree of toxicity on the liver, kidney and thymus tissue. Mice fed on DCWs treated by ozone mitigated the adverse effects compared with mice fed on DCWs. All the results suggested that the deleterious effects of DON could be highly reduced by ozone, and ozone itself shows minor toxic effects on animals in this process. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {Nucleotide sugars, the activated forms of monosaccharides, are important metabolites involved in a multitude of cellular processes including glycosylation of xenobiotics. Especially in plants, UDP-glucose is one of the most prominent members among these nucleotide-sugars, as it is involved in the formation of glucose conjugates of xenobiotics, including mycotoxins, but also holds a central role in the interconversion of energized sugars such as the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid required for cell wall biosynthesis. Here, we present the first HILIC-LC-ESI-TQ-MS/MS method for the quantification of UDP-glucose and UDP-glucuronic acid together with the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and its major plant detoxification product DON-3-O-glucoside (DON-3-Glc) utilizing a polymer-based column. For sample preparation a time-effective and straightforward 'dilute and shoot' protocol was applied. The chromatographic run time was minimized to 9min including proper column re-equilibration. In-house validation of the method verified its linear range, intra- (1-7%) and interday (8-20%) precision, instrumental LODs between 0.6 and 10ngmL-1, selectivity and moderate matrix effects with mean recoveries of 85-103%. To prove the methods applicability, we analyzed two sets of wheat extracts obtained from different cultivars grown under standardized greenhouse conditions. The results clearly demonstrated the suitability of the developed method to quantify UDP-glucose, DON and its masked form D3G in diluted wheat extracts. We observed differing concentration levels of UDP-glucose in the two wheat cultivars showing different resistance to the severe plant disease Fusarium head blight. We propose that the higher ability to detoxify DON into DON-3-Glc might be a consequence of the higher cellular UDP-glucose pool in the resistant cultivar. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Rice is a major cash crop for eastern Arkansas and generally involves intensive cultivation. Sediment is the primary pollutant identified for most eastern Arkansas waterways, and conservation practices like no-till are commonly recommended as remedial mechanisms. The profitability of no-till rice has been investigated, but the main emphasis has been on comparing mean returns of no-till to conventional till without consideration for return variability. Profitability in these studies is also evaluated from the prospective of the producer only, despite the fact that most cropland is owned by someone other than the producer. This study evaluates the profitability and risk efficiency of no-till management in Arkansas rice production from both the perspective of the tenant and the landlord using simulation and stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. Crop yields and prices are simulated for a typical two-year rice-soybean rotation, and tenant and landlord net return distributions are constructed for popular rental arrangements used in eastern Arkansas rice production. The results indicate that both the tenant and the landlord can benefit monetarily from no-till management. Risk-neutral and risk-averse tenants would both benefit from no-till management as no-till increases mean (expected) returns for risk-neutral tenants and results in large risk premiums over conventional till for risk-averse tenants. Risk-neutral landlords would be indifferent between either no-till or conventional till management because mean returns are essentially the same for both tillage methods. Risk-averse landlords would have a slight preference for no-till, since no-till risk premiums tend to be positive with increasing levels of risk aversion. However, no-till risk premiums are modest for risk-averse landlords, implying that risk would play less of a role for the landlord than for the tenant when considering the use of no-till management on rented land.},

This study examined the effect of unfavourable temperature (23 and 30 °C) and humidity (0.80-0.94 aw) storage conditions on mould growth in the stored barley ecosystem with its adverse microbiological state provided by contamination with Aspergillus westerdijkiae, Penicillium viridicatum and Fusarium poae. RESULTS: Among the applied storage parameters, aw turned out to be the main factor affecting mould development. The longest lag phase and period of fungal activation were observed for grain with 0.80 aw, which was not threatened with fungal development for at least 30 days. However, in grain with 0.92 and 0.94 aw, fungal activation occurred within 24-48 h. CONCLUSION: The obtained data and the identification of critical points in mould growth may be used to develop a control system for the postharvest preservation of barley based on aw and temperature of grain, which are easy to measure in practice. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum. These and other closely related fungi cause a disease known as Fusarium head blight (FHB) in small grain cereals. Other mycotoxins produced by FHB-causing fungi include nivalenol, T-2 toxin, and zearalenone. Ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated food and feed can lead to toxicosis in humans and animals, respectively. DON is the predominant and most economically important of these mycotoxins in the majority of small grain-producing regions of the world. This review examines the factors that influence DON accumulation in small grain cereals from an agricultural perspective. The occurrence and economic importance of FHB and DON in small grain cereals, epidemiological factors and cereal production practices that favor FHB development and DON accumulation in grain under field conditions, and regulatory/advisory standards for DON in food and feed are discussed. This information can be used to develop strategies that reduce DON accumulation in grain before harvest and to mitigate the human and animal health risks associated with DON contamination of food and feed. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this study, ediphenphos residue in rice was detected using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) on a portable Raman spectrometer. A simple pretreatment method for rice samples was developed, and uniform gold nanorods were used for SERS measurement. Characteristic signals can still be detected when ediphenphos concentration in rice extraction solution was higher than or equal to 0.1 mg/L. Quantitative analysis of ediphenphos was conducted by regression models developed using partial least-squares regression, random forest and kernel principal component analysis, and root-mean-square error of cross validation, coefficient of determination and relative predicted deviation of optimal model were 0.022 mg/L, 0.9967 and 297.45, which indicated the proposed method can predict ediphenphos concentration with high precision. To validate the feasibility of practical application further, rice samples spiked with 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 μg/g ediphenphos residue were analyzed using the above method. The predicted recovery was in the range of 93.4% to 102%, and the predicted error was small for residue of each concentration. These results demonstrated that the presented method could be used for accurate and quantitative detection of ediphenphos residue in rice. Practical Application: This study developed a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method for detection of ediphenphos in rice coupled with simple extraction protocol and gold nanorods on a portable Raman spectrometer. SERS is a rapid and accurate method which can be applied in agricultural grain safety inspection. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®},

   abstract = {Sweet corn is planted over a long season to temporally extend the perishable supply of ears for fresh and processing markets. Most growers' fields have weeds persisting to harvest (hereafter called residual weeds), and evidence suggests the crop's ability to endure competitive stress from residual weeds (i.e., crop tolerance) is not constant over the planting season. Field studies were conducted to characterize changes in the residual weed community over the long planting season and determine the extent to which planting date influences crop tolerance to weed interference in growth and yield traits. Total weed density at harvest was similar across five planting dates from mid-April to early-July; however, some changes in composition of species common to the midwestern United States were observed. Production of viable weed seed within the relatively short growth period of individual sweet corn plantings showed weed seedbank additions are influenced by species and planting date. Crop tolerances in growth and yield were variable in the mid-April and both May plantings, and the crop was least affected by weed interference in the mid-June and early-July planting dates. As the planting season progressed from late-May to early-July, sweet corn accounted for a great proportion of the total crop-weed biomass. Based on results from Illinois, a risk management perspective to weeds should recognize the significance of planting date on sweet corn competitive ability. This work suggests risk of yield loss from weed control failure is lower in late-season sweet corn plantings (June and July) than earlier plantings (April and May).},

Therefore, there is significant interest in developing methods for detecting coffee adulteration and improving the sensitivity and accuracy of these methods. Corn and other lower value crops are potential adulterants, along with sticks and coffee husks. Fourteen pure Brazilian roasted, ground coffee bean samples were adulterated with 1-20% of roasted, ground corn and were analyzed for their tocopherol content and profile by HPLC. They were also analyzed by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Both proposed methods of detection of corn adulteration displayed a sensitivity of around 5%, thus representing simple and fast analytical methods for detecting adulteration at likely levels of contamination. Further studies should be conducted to verify the results with a much larger sample size and additional types of adulterants. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Worldwide, food supplies often contain unavoidable contaminants, many of which adversely affect health and hence are subject to regulations of maximum tolerable levels in food. These regulations differ from nation to nation, and may affect patterns of food trade. We soughtto determine whether there is an association between nations' food safety regulations and global food trade patterns, with implications for public health and policymaking. We developed a network model of maize trade around the world. From maize import/export data for 217 nations from 2000-2009, we calculated basic statistics on volumes of trade; then examined how regulations of aflatoxin, a common contaminant of maize, are similar or different between pairs of nations engaging in significant amounts of maize trade. Globally, market segregation appears to occur among clusters of nations. The United States is at the center of one cluster; European countries make up another cluster with hardly any maize trade with the US; and Argentina, Brazil, and China export maize all over the world. Pairs of nations trading large amounts of maize have very similar aflatoxin regulations: nations with strict standards tend to trade maize with each other, while nations with more relaxed standards tend to trade maize with each other. Rarely among the top pairs of maize-trading nations do total aflatoxin standards (standards based on the sum of the levels of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2) differ by more than 5 μg/kg. These results suggest that, globally, separate maize trading communities emerge; and nations tend to trade with other nations that have very similar food safety standards. © 2012 Wu, Guclu.},

These chemicals were examined in insects and in the muscle, liver, and eggs of rice frogs (Rana limnocharis) from the paddy fields of an agricultural site in South China. The ΣDDT (sum of DDT, DDE, and DDD) concentrations ranged from 154 to 915, 195 to 1,400, and 165 to 1,930ng/g lipid weight in the muscle, liver, and eggs, respectively. All the DDTs (DDT, DDE, and DDD) showed higher affinity for the liver relative to muscle tissue and can be maternally transferred to eggs in female frogs. The average biomagnification factors for DDTs ranged from 1.6 to 1.9 and 1.5 to 2.9 in female and male frogs, respectively, providing clear evidence of their biomagnification from insects to frogs. Compared with the reported DDT levels demonstrated to have toxic effects on frogs, DDTs in the present frogs are unlikely to constitute an immediate health risk. However, the adverse impacts of high DDT residues in eggs on the hatching success and their potential toxicity to the newly metamorphosed larval frogs should be assessed further. © 2011 SETAC.},

   abstract = {The high content of amino acids of Chinese rice wine (CRW), especially essential amino acids makes it a food increasingly demanded by consumers. Rapid detection technique of amino acid content, which is an important quality and function index of CRW, is highly desirable for consumers, producers as well as administrative authorities. In this study, the potential of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) as a novel and rapid analytical technique to determine 17 free amino acids in CRW were investigated. Genetic algorithms (GA) and synergy interval partial least squares (SiPLS) were used to select the most efficient spectral variables to improve the prediction precision of the classic partial least squares (PLS) model constructed on the full-spectrum. The results demonstrated that compared with the PLS model using all wavelengths of FT-IR spectra, the prediction precision of model based on the spectral variables selected by GA and SiPLS was significantly improved, especially for arginine and proline. After systemic comparison and discussion, it was found that GA-SiPLS model achieved the best performance, with the correlation coefficient in calibration (R2 (cal)) higher than 0.80 and the residual predictive deviation higher than 2.00 for all of the free amino acids analyzed in this study. The overall results confirmed that FT-IR combined with efficient variable selection algorithms is a method that may be useful to replace the traditional methods for routine analysis of free amino acids in CRW. Practical Application: This research presented a rapid and accurate method to determine the free amino acid contents in Chinese rice wine without sophisticated pretreatment of the samples. The approach reported in this study could be applied to quality control in wineries. It would also be useful to authenticity assurance to prevent illegal adulteration and to guarantee the correct value estimation. © 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of heavy metal monitoring data in paddy rice to provide a scientific basis for food safety risk assessment and suggestions for possible risk management. In this study, the spatial distribution data of heavy metals (cadmium, lead, total arsenic, total chromium, and total mercury) in rice collected in the main production provinces of China were analyzed by multidimensional visualization and aggregation analysis. The spatial correlation of elemental contamination was also identified. Monitoring data of cadmium, lead, and arsenic content in different varieties of rice was compared with their mean confidence intervals. Results showed that cadmium content in rice was higher than the limit value in some areas of Hunan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Anhui Provinces in China. With respect to other heavy metals, a small area of Sichuan Province experienced lead levels in rice higher than the limit value. Also, the arsenic level in rice was higher than the limit value in Jiangxi Province, a northern area of Liaoning Province and most parts of Guangzhou and its surrounding areas. In contrast, chromium was only detected at excessive levels in southern Sichuan Province. In addition, a small part of the eastern Sichuan Province was found to have excessive levels of arsenic. Moran's I index of cadmium, arsenic, chromium, lead, and mercury in rice was 0.50, 0.55, 0.21, 0.09, and 0.05, respectively, which revealed a spatial autocorrelation. Overall, there was moderate aggregation of cadmium and arsenic in the monitoring areas, while lead, chromium and mercury showed low aggregation. Geographically for the provinces, the high aggregation of cadmium in rice was evident in Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces and Guangdong border areas. The arsenic in Jiangxi Province and border areas of Jiangxi and Guangdong Provinces also showed high level of aggregation. Meanwhile, the parameter testing of the samples showed that the concentration of cadmium and lead were significantly higher in late Indica rice compared to early Indica rice, while the arsenic and chromium showed the opposite effect. In view of the high levels of certain heavy metals in rice in some provinces, more refined dietary intake assessments of rice as consumed are necessary to determine if populations are exposed to levels that exceed the health-based guidance levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

During the growth season, rice plants are inevitably subjected to numerous stresses, among which heavy metal stress represented by cadmium contamination not only hindering the yield of rice but also affecting the food safety by Cd accumulating in rice grains. The mechanism of Cd accumulation in rice grains has not been well elucidated. In this study, we compare the proteomic difference between two genotypes with different Cd accumulation ability in grains. Verification of differentially expressed protein-encoding genes was analyzing by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and reanalysis of microarray expression data. Forty-seven proteins in total were successfully identified through proteomic screening. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed Cd accumulation triggered stress-related pathways in the cells, and strongly affecting metabolic pathways. Many proteins associated with nutrient reservoir and starch-related enzyme were identified in this study suggesting that a considerably damage on grain quality was caused. The results also implied stress response was initiated by the abnormal cells and the transmission of signals may mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS).

   abstract = {Occurrence of pharmaceuticals, particularly antibiotics, in water bodies and water streams has raised increasing worries about the potential risks to human health and ecosystems. Norfloxacin is a popularly used fluoroquinolone antibiotic and considered as an emerging pharmaceutical contaminant. In this paper, adsorption of norfloxacin from artificial wastewater was done by the pretreated barley straw (PBS) that was made from raw barley straw with H3PO4 impregnation and microwave heating. The experimentally maximum norfloxacin adsorption capacity of PBS was 349 ± 17 mg/g at 298.15 K and pH 6.96. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms with respect to temperature were evaluated. The results indicated that adsorption of norfloxacin on PBS was an endothermic process. The adsorption site energy and its distribution based on the Langmuir-Freundlich model were determined to describe the adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the percentage of adsorption sites, the site energy of which are greater than or equal to a specific energy E∗, was estimated. The proposed dominant driving forces, electron-donor-acceptor interactions (n-π and π-π) between the polarizable PBS (carboxyl and aromatic groups, as n- and π-electron-donors) and norfloxacin (carbon atom in benzene ring attached to F, as a π-electron-acceptor), were investigated by the C and O K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we report studies conducted in eastern Canada to address this issue. In one study, oat genotypes of diverse origin were evaluated for grain and groat deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination owing to artificial FHB inoculation at Ottawa, ON, in 2006 and 2007. In a separate study, oat genotypes tested in the yearly Quebec Oat Registration and Recommendation Trials were evaluated for DON contamination due to artificial inoculation in Quebec from 2003 to 2008. Deoxynivalenol was detected in all tested genotypes, and up to 43 μg g-1 of DON was observed in the oat grain. Up to 86% of the DON in the oat grain was removed by dehulling. However, some genotypes still retained up to 9 μg g-1 of DON in the groat. Genotype ranking in DON content was relatively consistent across years, planting dates, and experiments, and genotypes with consistently low and high DON levels were identified. It was concluded that FHB is a potential problem for oat production and oat food safety under high FHB pressures; however, the severity of this problem needs to be further assessed by extensive monitoring of the DON level under natural conditions. The most susceptible genotypes identified in this study can be useful for this purpose. © Crop Science Society of America.},

In total, 1,894 single spore isolates were obtained. The isolates were characterized at the species level by a newly developed and robust set of diagnostic primers based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among members of the F. graminearum clade. In addition, we determined their chemotype using previously described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. The results showed that in all regions F. asiaticum was the predominant species causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) on barley in China (N = 1,706), while in the upper valleys of the Yangtze River also F. graminearum sensu stricto, F. meridionale, and F. proliferatum were found. Major differences in the chemotypes were found in the F. asiaticum populations, from very high to exclusive nivalenol (NIV) chemotypes in the mountainous upper valleys of the Yangtze River to predominantly deoxynivalenol (DON) chemotypes in the middle and lower valleys. In contrast to the F. asiaticum isolates from three counties in Sichuan province, which were largely NIV producers (278 of 291), F. graminearum isolates from these sampling sites were for the vast majority (27 of 28) DON producers, indicating that despite sharing the same habitat, these sympatric species apparently have unique mycotoxin chemotypes. © 2008 The American Phytopathological Society.},

   abstract = {Determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) is highly important for food safety control. In this study, a signal-on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor which combined the characteristics of high efficiency of hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) and high selectivity of aptamer was developed for OTA determination. The capture probe DNA (CDNA) was firstly immobilized on the gold electrode surface through Au-S interaction, then the OTA aptamer was modified on the electrode surface through hybridization with CDNA. Since OTA can competitively bind with the aptamer due to their high affinity, which would induce the releasing of aptamer from the electrode surface. Subsequently, the free CDNA on the electrode surface can hybridize with the padlock probe and induce HRCA reaction subsequently. Thus, the HRCA products which contained large amount of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments can be accumulated on the electrode surface. Since Ru(phen)32+ can intercalate into the groove of dsDNA and acts as ECL indicator, high ECL intensity can be detected from the electrode surface. The enhanced ECL intensity has a linear relationship with OTA in the range of 0.05-500. pg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9957, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.02. pg/mL. The developed biosensor has been applied to determine OTA concentration in the corn samples with satisfied results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Foods high in resistant starch (RS) are beneficial to prevent various diseases including diabetes, colon cancers, diarrhea and chronic renal or hepatic diseases. Elevated RS in rice is important for public health since rice is a staple food for half of the world population. A japonica mutant 'Jiangtangdao 1' (RS = 11.67%) was crossed with an indica cultivar 'Miyang 23' (RS = 0.41%). The mutant sbe3-rs that explained 60.4% of RS variation was mapped between RM6611 and RM13366 on chromosome 2 (LOD = 36) using 178 F-2 plants genotyped with 106 genome-wide polymorphic SSR markers. Using 656 plants from four F-3:4 families, sbe3-rs was fine mapped to a 573.3 Kb region between InDel 2 and InDel 6 using one STS, five SSRs and seven InDel markers. SBE3 which codes for starch branching enzyme was identified as a candidate gene within the putative region. Nine pairs of primers covering 22 exons were designed to sequence genomic DNA of the wild type for SBE3 and the mutant for sbe3-rs comparatively. Sequence analysis identified a missense mutation site where Leu-599 of the wild was changed to Pro-599 of the mutant in the SBE3 coding region. Because the point mutation resulted in the loss of a restriction enzyme site, sbe3-rs was not digested by a CAPS marker for SpeI site while SBE3 was. Co-segregation of the digestion pattern with RS content among 178 F2 plants further supported sbe3-rs responsible for RS in rice. As a result, the CAPS marker could be used in marker-assisted breeding to develop rice cultivars with elevated RS which is otherwise difficult to accurately assess in crops. Transgenic technology should be employed for a definitive conclusion of the sbe3-rs.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are toxic secondary metabolites predominantly produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxin-contaminated corn is toxic to domestic animals when ingested in feed and is a known carcinogen associated with liver and lung cancer in humans. Consequently, aflatoxin levels in food and feed are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allows 20 ppb (parts per billion) limits in food and 100 ppb in feed for interstate commerce. Currently, aflatoxin detection and quantification methods are based on analytical tests, including thin-layer chromatography (TCL) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These analytical tests require the destruction of samples and are costly and time consuming. Thus, the ability to detect aflatoxin in a rapid, nondestructive way is crucial to the grain industry, particularly the corn industry. Hyperspectral imaging technology offers a non-invasive approach to screening for food safety inspection and quality control based on spectral signatures. The focus of this study was to classify aflatoxin-contaminated single corn kernels using fluorescence hyperspectral imagery. Field-inoculated corn kernels were used in the study. Contaminated and control kernels under long-wavelength ultraviolet excitation were imaged using a visible near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral camera. The imaged kernels were chemically analyzed to provide reference information for image analysis. This article describes a procedure for processing corn kernels located in different images for statistical training and classification. Two classification algorithms (maximum likelihood and binary encoding) were used to classify each corn kernel as "control" or "contaminated" through pixel classification. The binary encoding approach had a slightly better performance, with accuracy equal to 87% or 88% when 20 ppb or 100 ppb, respectively, was used as the classification threshold. In addition, three narrow-band fluorescence indices were developed and tested in this study. It was found that the highest correlation was -0.81 with the normalized difference fluorescence index (NDFI). The two bands used for the NDFI were 437 and 537 nm. The use of key wavelengths for contamination detection would be helpful for developing rapid and non-invasive inspection systems. This study demonstrated the potential of using fluorescence hyperspectral imagery for aflatoxin contamination detection in corn kernels infected with A. flavus.},

Amino acid profiles analyzed by an amino acid analyzer together with principal component analysis (PCA) was used for validation of the wine age of the Chinese rice wine samples sourced from 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year. E-tongue responses collected by a potentiometric E-tongue together with discriminant analysis (DA) were used for the rapid discrimination of the wine age. The correlation between the E-tongue responses and the amino acid profiles was established by partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that the calibration and validation samples were all correctly discriminated by the E-tongue coupled with DA. The E-tongue could be used for screening isoleucine (Ile), aspartic acid (Asp), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val), with a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of greater than 2.0. The results indicated that using an E-tongue combined with DA was a reliable method for the discrimination of the wine age of Chinese rice wines. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

   abstract = {Background: Many animal studies have been performed on products with the Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin-encoding gene (Bt products), but less have focused on its effects on intestinal microflora owing to difficulties in culturing. This 90 day study was designed to assess unintended effects of genetically modified T2A-1 rice (GMR) on selected intestinal bacteria (Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium genus, Escherichia coli subgroup, Enterococcus genus and Clostridium perfringens) of rats by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results: During the whole experiment, no statistically significant differences in the numbers of specific bacteria and total bacteria were found between the GMR group and its parental group. At all stages of the experiment the two main probiotics (Lactobacillus group and Bifidobacterium genus) in faeces accounted for 11-23% of the total bacteria, whereas the conditional pathogens (E. coli subgroup, Enterococcus genus and C. perfringens) made up less than 1% of the total bacteria. B/E (log 10 copies of Bifidobacterium genome g -1 faeces/log 10 copies of E. coli genome g -1 faeces) ratios from 1.19 to 1.34 were obtained. Furthermore, significant correlations (P &lt; 0.01) between the real-time PCR method and the plate count method were found, with r values ranging from 0.60 to 0.75. Conclusion: No adverse effects on the numbers of specific bacteria in rat faeces were observed as a result of GMR feeding. The real-time PCR method is recommended in further studies on the composition and dynamics of the intestinal bacteria community for better safety assessment of GM materials. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.},

The fluorescence sensing material was constructed from anchoring the MIP layer on IL modified CdSe/ZnS QDs by copolymerization, which had been developed for the detection of carbaryl in rice and Chinese cabbage. The MIP fluorescence was more strongly quenched by carbaryl than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP) fluorescence, which indicated that the QDs@MIP could selectively recognize the corresponding carbaryl. Furthermore, the developed QDs@MIP method was validated by HPLC and ELISA respectively, and the results of these methods were well correlated (R2 = 0.98). The fluorescence sensing material had obvious advantages, such as being easily prepared and having specific recognition and photostability. The developed method was simple and effective for the detection of carbaryl. And, it could also provide the technical support for the rapid detection in food safety fields. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin identified as a contaminant in grains and wine throughout the world, and convenient, rapid and sensitive detection methods for OTA have been a long-felt need for food safety monitoring. Herein, we presented a new competitive format based lateral flow strip fluorescent aptasensor for one-step determination of OTA in corn samples. Briefly, biotin-cDNA was immobilized on the surface of a nitrocellulose filter on the test line. Without OTA, Cy5-labeled aptamer combined with complementary strands formed a stable double helix. In the presence of OTA, however, the Cy5-aptamer/OTA complexes were generated, and therefore less free aptamer was captured in the test zone, leading to an obvious decrease in fluorescent signals on the test line. The test strip showed an excellent linear relationship in the range from 1 ng·mL-1 to 1000 ng·mL-1 with the LOD of 0.40 ng·mL-1, IC15 value of 3.46 ng·mL-1 and recoveries from 96.4% to 104.67% in spiked corn samples. Thus, the strip sensor developed in this study is an acceptable alternative for rapid detection of the OTA level in grain samples. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Initially, the specific sequence of the anti-OTA aptamer labeled with a biotin group, was attached to streptavidin-modified MBs. Two single-stranded signal probes were added and naturally hybridized with anti-OTA aptamer to form the duplex structure in the solution. Due to the fact that single-stranded oligonucleotides can greatly enhance the emission of Tb3+ in solution but duplexes do not, through magnetic separation, the supernatant liquid of the above solution contained no single-stranded DNA and cannot increase the emission of Tb3+. While upon OTA addition, it will bind with aptamer to form OTA-aptamer G-quadruplex while releasing two single-stranded signal probes. Through magnetic separation, the released single-stranded signal probes left in the supernatant liquid can dramatically increase the fluorescent intensity of Tb3+. By employing the above strategy, this aptasensor can detect as low as 20pg/mL OTA with high specificity. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed aptasensor is the first attempt to use the fluorescent characteristics of Tb3+ for OTA detection, which may represent a promising path toward routine quality control of food safety. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

To this end, the sorption of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to DF extracted from wheat bran (WB) was studied. The strong affinity of PAHs to DF and WB indicated the effective binding of PAHs, and their distribution coefficients (Kd) positively increased with the increase in hydrophobicity of the PAHs. The DF had much higher Kd values for all PAHs compared to those of the unprocessed WB. The DF extraction process removed hydrophilic residues, such as starch, from WB, and increased the roughness of DF surface. Loss of hydrophilic components from WB to DF led to much higher affinity of DF with PAHs than WB. The results indicate that the DF can effectively sorb and remove xenobiotics, thereby having the potential to lower carcinogenic risk to humans. © 2016 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Rice is a major source of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the human diet because paddy rice. efficient at accumulating As Rice As speciation is dominated by iAs and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Here we review the global pattern in rice As speciation and the factors causing the variation. Rice produced in Asia shows a strong linear relationship between iAs and total As concentration with a slope of 0.78. Rice produced in Europe and the United States shows a more variable, but generally hyperbolic relationship with DMA being predominant in U.S. rice. Although there is significant genotypic variation in grain As speciation, the regional Variations are primarily attributed to environmental factors. Emerging evidence also indicates that methylated. As species in rice are derived from the soil, while rice plants lack the As methylation ability. Soil flooding and additions of organic matter increase microbial methylation of As, although the microbial community responsible for methylafion is poorly understood. Compared with iAs, methylated As species are taken up by rice roots less efficiently but are transported to the grain much, more efficiently, which may be an important factor responsible for the spikelet sterility disorder (straight head disease) in rice. DMA is a weak carcinogen, but the level of ingestion from rice consumption is much lower than that of concern. Questions that require further investigations are identified.},

Thus, it is important to know the effect of chemicals on the biological control agents. In this study, we assessed the toxicity of commonly used insecticides on a biological control agent, Trichogramma japonicum Ahmead (an egg parasitoid of rice lepidopterans) by using a dry film residue method. Results showed that thirty insecticides from seven chemical classes exhibited various degree of toxicity to this parasitoid. Among the seven classes of chemicals tested, organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, phoxim, profenofos, and triazophos) and carbamates (carbaryl, carbsulfan, isoprocarb, metolcarb, and promecarb) exhibited the highest intrinsic toxicity to T. japponicum, with an LC50 of 0.035 (0.0290.044) to 0.49 (0.340.87) mg active ingredient (a.i.) L -1, followed by antibiotics (abamectin, emamectin benzoate, and ivermectin), phenylpyrazoles (butane-fipronil, ethiprole, and fipronil), pyrethroids (cyhalthrin, Cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, and lambda-cyhaothrin), and neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, imidaclothiz, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam). Moreover, the insect growth regulator insecticides (chlorfluazuron, fufenozide, hexaflumuron and tebufenozide) exhibited the lowest toxicity to the wasps with an LC50 of 3,383 (24065499) to 30206 (2310741008) mg a.i. L -1. Risk quotient analysis showed that phenylpyrazoles, pyrethroids, insect growth regulators, neonicotinoids (with the exception of thiamethoxam), and antibiotics (with the exception of abamectin) are classified as safe agents to the parasitoid, while organophosphates and carbamates are classified as slightly, moderately, or highly toxic agents to the parasitoid. The data presented in this paper provided useful information on the selection of compatible insecticides with T. japonicum. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.},

Aflatoxin contamination remains a problem in agricultural products due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties. Conventional chemical methods for aflatoxin detection are time-consuming and destructive. This study employed fluorescence and reflectance visible near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral images to classify aflatoxin contaminated corn kernels rapidly and non-destructively. Corn ears were artificially inoculated in the field with toxigenic A. flavus spores at the early dough stage of kernel development. After harvest, a total of 300 kernels were collected from the inoculated ears. Fluorescence hyperspectral imagery with UV excitation and reflectance hyperspectral imagery with halogen illumination were acquired on both endosperm and germ sides of kernels. All kernels were then subjected to chemical analysis individually to determine aflatoxin concentrations. A region of interest (ROI) was created for each kernel to extract averaged spectra. Compared with healthy kernels, fluorescence spectral peaks for contaminated kernels shifted to longer wavelengths with lower intensity, and reflectance values for contaminated kernels were lower with a different spectral shape in 700-800 nm region. Principal component analysis was applied for data compression before classifying kernels into contaminated and healthy based on a 20 ppb threshold utilizing the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. The best overall accuracy achieved was 92.67% for germ side in the fluorescence data analysis. The germ side generally performed better than endosperm side. Fluorescence andreflectance image data achieved similar accuracy. © 2015 SPIE.},

   abstract = {The health risks associated with rice consumption may decrease if consumers use cooking practices which can reduce the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s. The effects of cooking on the Cd and As bioaccessibility, at three contamination levels of rice, were studied. Results indicated that cooking reduced bioaccessibility of Cd and As in rice. Cooking resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.01) of Cd and As concentrations in the residual fraction. Low volume water-cooking of rice to dryness reduced total Cd by about 10% for rices A and B, while medium or high volume water-cooking had no effect on Cd bioaccessibility in all rice types. In contrast, low volume cooking did not remove As, but a significant decrease (p < 0.05) was observed when cooking with higher volumes of water. This study provides information for a better understanding of more realistic estimation of metal(loid) s exposure from rice and the possible health risks. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Results showed that spinosad was the most effective bio-insecticide against S. oryzae at all exposure periods. Likewise, diatomaceous earth caused the highest mortality percentage compared to the other tested inert dusts. A three and five days exposure periods were adequate to completely kill S. oryzae under modified atmospheres containing 80% and (40 and 60%) CO2</ sub> gas in the air, respectively. Therefore, spinosad, diatomaceous earth and modified atmospheres could be consider eco-friendly control methods and promising alternatives to conventional pesticides, as they have low mammalian toxicity and low or zero residual effects in food.},

   abstract = {Various parameters were assessed in samples of 2 rice mill by-products, namely broken rice and rice bran, taken from 4 rice mill establishments in Western Greece, for their characterization as feed ingredients. The analyses (152 in total), based on European Union (EU) methods, included determination of major nutrients, ash insoluble in HCI, trace elements, heavy metals, aflatoxin B, and microbial load. Mean values of crude protein (152), crude fibre (70.3), ash (82.7) and especially fat (155 g kg(-1) on dry matter basis), revealed that the assumed rice bran was not actually a brown or white bran, but rice pollards, i.e. a mixture of bran and polishing. Presence of Pb, Cd and aflatoxin B(1) was not detected in any of the broken rice or bran samples. Average values for enumeration of total bacterial counts were 4.65 and 5.67: whereas that of yeasts/moulds were 2.73 and 4.13 log cfu g(-1) for broken rice and bran, respectively, being below permitted levels for broken rice, but raising concern about storage of rice bran. Information from this study aims at contributing to measures taken by the State to cope with EU legislation on food and feed safety, developing traceability procedures and establishing HACCP system as well as GMP programme for Greece and elsewhere.},

   abstract = {Cereals are of major importance in human and animal nutrition, and the mycotoxin content is of great health and economic concern for the food sector and consumers. In Europe, Fusarium graminearum (FG) is the prevalent Fusarium species leading to Fusarium head blight on small grain cereals and contamination of grains by its main mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). The present study assessed the costs of preventive agronomic measures to reduce the risk of DON contamination in wheat besides the use of fungicides. The abatement costs were calculated by linking actual data on wheat production costs and profits with assessments of DON contents based on results of the forecast model FusaProg for the period 2005-2011. Analysis revealed that ploughing was a relatively efficient measure to reduce DON risk compared with modifying crop rotation or growing a more FG-resistant wheat variety. Given a threshold value of 1·25 mg DON/kg wheat, a reduction of 0·1 mg DON was related to additional production costs of at least 2·5%. These economic findings are of relevance for farmers and policy makers in order to define sustainable production systems enabling both a high level of food safety and reducing the use of plant protection products. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.},

Mitigation strategies to reduce HMF are not yet available. This study showed that cysteine alone or in combination with glycine could simultaneously and significantly reduce the content of acrylamide and HMF in asparagine/glucose model as well as in biscuits. Mixing 0.36 g/100 g of cysteine and 0.2 g(100 g (w/w) of glycine into the dough reduced 97.8% and 93.2% of acrylamide and HMF, respectively, in biscuits. Cysteine reduced HMF content possibly by reacting with formed HMF through Michael adduction and Maillard reaction. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
