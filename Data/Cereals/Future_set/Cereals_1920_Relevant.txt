   abstract = {This survey was conducted to investigate the contamination by multiple mycotoxins, aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2), ochratoxin A (OTA), and zearalenone (ZEA) in 61 samples of maize and 17 commercial animal feed samples, and of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in raw dairy milk samples (n = 20) collected from Assiut City in Upper Egypt. Multi-mycotoxin immunoaffinity columns were used for samples cleanup and mycotoxin purification. An HPLC-FLD system with an on-line post-column photochemical derivatization was used for the detection of the target toxins. AFB1 was detected in both maize (n = 15) and feed (n = 8), with only one maize sample presenting a concentration above the maximum permissible level set by the Egyptian authorities. AFB2 was observed in six maize samples and in one feed sample, with a maximum value of 0.5 μg/kg. ZEA was detected only in feed samples (n = 4), with a maximum value of 3.5 μg/kg, while OTA, AFG1, and AFG2 were under the limits of detection. For milk, all the analyzed samples (100%) were contaminated with AFM1, and 14 samples (70%) presented concentrations above the maximum permissible level in the European Union (EU) (0.05 μg/kg). The concentrations ranged from 0.02 μg/kg to 0.19 μg/kg, except that of one sample, which was under the limit of quantification. The contamination rates in maize and animal feeds are not alarming. In contrast, the consumption of dairy milk samples in Assiut City may pose public health hazards, as AFM1 levels were found to exceed the international permissible limits. Further surveys are highly recommended in order to establish a database for mycotoxin occurrence in Egypt to minimize the possible health risks in animals and humans. © 2018 by the authors.},

Two locally manufactured and one imported milling plates were used in both dry and wet milling of maize samples collected from different geographical locations in the country (N = 12). Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analyser techniques were used to detect and quantify the metals present as contaminant in the flour samples over a seven-week period. While Na, Fe, Zn, Mn, Mg, Ca and Al were detected, As, Cd, Cu, Co, Pb and Ni were either absent or below detection limits. The concentrations of the metals were observed to decline with continuous use of milling plates, with Mg recording the highest of concentrations in each week and Mn, the vice versa. The results showed that the quality of the milling plates contributed to the levels of metals seen in the samples. In terms of the extent of contamination, the imported plate was deemed best of the three milling plates used whiles the two locally manufactured plates were comparable. Wet milling process was touted as better than dry milling in contributing to metal contamination of milled food products. Also, the maize samples collected from different places were shown to exhibit varying metal concentrations. The sample from Ejura-Sekyere Dumase was showed to be more contaminated than from other sources. When the flours were used to produce consumable foods, porridge and kenkey, the metal concentrations in them were comparable. The outcomes of the study show that education on sources of food contamination should be organized for stakeholders in the maize cultivation and processing industry and regulatory systems should also be strengthened to safeguard consumers’ health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Aflatoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that contaminate dietary staples worldwide, including maize, rice and groundnuts. Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is a public health concern due to their carcinogenic, acute and chronic effects. Rice is an important staple food consumed widely and consists of a major part of the diets for half of the world population. Human exposure to these mycotoxins is a serious problem especially in developing countries where hot and humid climates favor the fungal growth and where food storage conditions are poor and lack of regulatory limits enforcement. The recent developments of biomarkers have provided opportunities in assessing aflatoxins exposure and related health effects in the high-risk population groups. This review describes the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins in rice during the period from 1990 to 2015 and biomarkers-based evidence for human exposure to aflatoxins and their adverse health effects. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatocarcinogen and humans may expose to it at any stage of life. Epidemiological studies reported an association between aflatoxin intake and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in some sub-Saharan and Asian countries. Even daily high intake of rice with a low level of contamination is of health concern. Thus, it is necessary to implement effective strategies to prevent contamination and fungal growth in rice. A good agricultural and manufacturing practice should be applied during handling, storage and distribution of rice to ensure that aflatoxins contamination level is lower in the final product. Moreover, a regular survey for aflatoxins occurrence in rice and biomarkers-based studies is recommended to prevent and reduce the adverse health effects in the world population. © 2019 The Author},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the fate of fumonisins in transgenic and non-transgenic corn during industrial dry milling. For this purpose, whole corn samples and their fractions (germ, pericarp, endosperm, corn meal, and grits) were collected from one of the major Brazilian milling plants, totaling 480 samples. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between mean fumonisin (FB1 + FB2) levels in transgenic (1130g/kg) and non-transgenic (920g/kg) whole corn. However, in non-transgenic germ, endosperm and corn meal fraction fumonisin levels were higher (2940g/kg, 250g/kg and 190g/kg, respectively) than in transgenic fractions (2180g/kg, 130g/kg and 85.0g/kg, respectively). Furthermore, the highest percentages of fumonisins were distributed in the germ, corresponding to about 87 and 76% of the total fumonisins present in the whole corn from non-transgenic and transgenic hybrids, respectively. Concerning the endosperm from non-transgenic and transgenic corn, approximately, 23% and 13% of the total fumonisins were retained after the dry milling. Further processing in corn meal (300 to 420 m particle size) and grits (590 to 1190m) decreased the percentages of remaining fumonisins to 4% and 2% (transgenic) and 10% and 3% (non-transgenic corn), respectively. These results suggested that fumonisin concentration was higher in outer and inner non-transgenic fractions when compared to transgenic ones and that the fate of fumonisins during the industrial dry milling could be affected by the transgenic status. However, it was not possible to conclude that the difference was exclusively due to this variable.},

Interseeding cover crops can promote beneficial insect communities and their ecosystem services such as predation on pests, and this practice is gaining interest from farmers. In this study, cereal rye (Secale cereale) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) were planted between rows of early vegetative corn that had been seed-treated with thiamethoxam. Thiamethoxam and its insecticidal metabolite, clothianidin were quantified in cover crop leaves throughout the growing season. Thiamethoxam was present in cereal rye at concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.33 ± 0.09 ng/g of leaf tissue and was detected on six out of seven collection dates. Cereal rye leaves contained clothianidin at concentrations from 1.05 ± 0.22 to 2.61 ± 0.24 ng/g and was present on all sampling dates. Both thiamethoxam and clothianidin were detected in hairy vetch on all sampling dates at rates ranging from 0.10 ± 0.05 to 0.51 ± 0.11 ng/g and 0.56 ± 0.15 to 9.73 ± 5.04 ng/g of leaf tissue, respectively. Clothianidin was measured at a higher concentration than its precursor, thiamethoxam, in both plant species on every sampling date. Neonicotinoids entering interseeded cover crops from adjacent treated plants is a newly discovered route of exposure and potential hazard for non-target beneficial invertebrates. Future research efforts should examine the effects of systemic insecticides on biological communities in agroecosystems whose goal is to diversify plant communities using methods such as cover cropping. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most important cereals worldwide, and its quality is affected by fungal contamination such as species of the genus Alternaria. No information is available about the occurrence of Alternaria mycotoxins in Argentinean barley grains, which is of concern, because they can be transferred into malt and beer. The aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence of alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and tenuazonic acid (TeA) in malting barley grains from the main producing region of Argentina during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. RESULTS: The most frequent mycotoxin was AOH (64%), which was detected at higher levels (712 μg kg−1) compared with other studies, followed by TeA (37%, 1522 μg kg−1), while AME was present in five samples in the 2015 growing season only, with a mean of 4876 μg kg−1. A similar frequency of mycotoxin occurrence was observed in both years (80.8 vs 85.3%), but more diverse contamination was found in 2015, which was characterized by lower accumulated precipitation. Nevertheless, AOH was more frequently found in 2014 than in 2015 (80.8 and 47.1% respectively). A negative correlation between AOH concentration and temperature was observed. The susceptibility of different barley varieties to mycotoxin accumulation varied with the mycotoxin, geographical location and meteorological conditions. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present work represent a tool for risk assessment of exposition to these mycotoxins and could be used by food safety authorities to determine the need for their regulation. Furthermore, the establishment of a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system to minimize fungal and mycotoxin contamination in barley from farm to processing could be apply to ensure food safety. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {Background: Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced primarily by the fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum in cereal grains. It causes vomiting, anorexia, reduced weight gain, and impaired immune function in multiple animal species. Several outbreaks of human gastroenteritis in different populations worldwide suggest a possible link to dietary DON exposure. Because of these acute and chronic health risks, the United Nations (UN) Codex Alimentarius Commission has recently set guidelines on maximum tolerable DON levels in wheat, barley, and maize. Scope and approach: This review describes DON occurrence in wheat worldwide, and current regulations regarding DON in foods set by Codex Alimentarius Commission and some individual countries. We review toxicological evaluations of DON and extend global human health risk assessments for different age-subgroups. Whether the recent Codex DON guidelines are adequately protective is addressed on the basis of risk assessments with and without these guidelines in place, in different nations of the world. Key findings and conclusions: Using updated wheat consumption data from the FAO/WHO Chronic individual food consumption database (CIFOCO), we found adult populations in Brazil, China and Belgium and child populations in Australia, China, and Belgium have DON exposures that could pose chronic health risks. The new Codex guidelines for DON in wheat are stricter than most nations' current regulatory standards. Some populations worldwide may not be well protected even if Codex standards are applied, because of high wheat consumption. In those populations, pre- and postharvest interventions to reduce DON in wheat should be implemented to protect health.},

Ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fusarenone X, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3-acetyldeoxinivalenol, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin were not detected. Water activity (Aw) of these samples exceeded 0.73; there was no correlation between Aw and the levels of mycotoxins. This is the first study to evaluate the occurrence of mycotoxins in Peruvian purple maize, and it ascertained that this variety may pose a risk to public health. Therefore, there is a need to control this grain supply chain in order to determine the factors involved in the presence of these toxins, and to establish regulatory limits or guidelines for maximum tolerated levels. © 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers},

   abstract = {The main objective of this research was to perform an exposure assessment of mycotoxin intake through consumption of wheat-based products in Serbia, Croatia, and Greece by estimating deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) exposure from wheat. Food consumption survey of wheat-based products has been performed during 2017 in the three countries with at least 1000 interviewees per country. Values for the concentration of DON and ZEA were extracted from available research published in this decade. Finally, a Monte Carlo analysis of 100,000 simulations was performed to estimate the intake of DON and ZEA from consumption of wheat-based products. Results revealed that the estimated daily wheat-borne intake of DON of the adult population in Croatia was 0.121 μg/kg bw/day, followed by Greece with 0.181 μg/kg bw/day and Serbia with 0.262 μg/kg bw/day. This shows that 0.25% of Croatian, 1.19% of Greek and 3.96% of Serbian adult population is exposed to higher daily dietary intakes of DON than recommended. Estimated daily wheat-borne intake of ZEA was 0.017 μg/kg bw/day in Greece, 0.026 μg/kg bw/day in Croatia and 0.050 μg/kg bw/day in Serbia. Higher intake of ZEA is associated with 0.62% of the Greek population, followed by 0.95% Croatian and 2.25% of Serbian citizens. This type of research is helpful to assess accurately the risk by DON/ZEA intake associated with the consumption of wheat-based products by consumers in these three countries. Distributions of potential mycotoxin intakes were highly right-skewed. © 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of cereals is a significant health risk for humans and animals, particularly in developing countries. To gain insight into food safety related to agricultural practices, we assessed levels of mycotoxin contamination in 105 samples of food grains raised and stored for consumption by rural households in the post-conflict districts of Kitgum and Lamwo in Northern Uganda. Aflatoxin, ochratoxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination was assessed by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total aflatoxin in the foods analyzed varied from nd (not detected) to 68.2 mu g/Kg. Ochratoxin ranged from 0.1 to 16.4 mu g/Kg. DON ranged from nd to 2606 mu g/Kg. The mean concentration of total aflatoxins was significantly higher (P = 0.002) in sorghum than in millet, maize and sesame seeds. Frequency of co-occurrence of two mycotoxins ranged from 8.3 to 100%, with the highest being aflatoxin and ochratoxin in sorghum. Co-occurrence of all three mycotoxins ranged from 8.3 to 35.3%, with the highest again being in sorghum. Mean levels of aflatoxins concentration in sorghum samples were 11.8 mu g/Kg, exceeding the Ugandan national regulatory limits of 10 mu g/Kg. Furthermore, 46.5% of the sorghum consumed in both districts exceeded this limit, and 86.1% of sorghum samples exceeded the European Union (E.U.) maximum tolerable limit of 4 mu g/Kg. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Hazard Indices (HI) values were in the range of 1.2 x 10(-5)-91.521 and 1.3 x 10(-7) to 0.0059, respectively. In conclusion, our results provide evidence of high levels of mycotoxin contamination and co-occurrence in food grains in Northern Uganda with aflatoxins and ochratoxins at high levels in all the cereal types analyzed. Consumption of cereals cultivated in this region poses no health risk of mycotoxins exposure since HI values obtained were less than 1.},

   abstract = {Cereals are prone to fungal infection during growth, harvesting, transportation, and/or storage. As a result, cereals such as wheat grains and wheat-derived products may be contaminated with mycotoxins leading to acute and chronic health exposure. The current study investigated the presence of the mycotoxins: Ochratoxin A (OTA), ochratoxin B (OTB), T-2, and HT-2 toxins in samples of wheat grains (n = 50), wheat flour (n = 50), and bread (n = 37) from the main mills in Lebanon using LC-MS/MS. Accuracy ranged from 98-100%, recoveries from 93-105%, and intraday and interday precision were 5-7% and 9-12%, respectively. The tested wheat grains, wheat flour, and bread samples did not contain detectable levels of T-2 and HT-2 toxins and OTB. Four wheat flour samples (8% of flour samples) showed positive OTA levels ranging from 0.6-3.4 μg kg-1 with an arithmetic mean of 1.9 ± 0.2 μg kg-1. Only one sample contained an OTA concentration greater than the limit set by the European Union (3 μg kg-1) for wheat-derived products. This study suggests that mycotoxin contamination of wheat grains, wheat flour, and bread in Lebanon is currently not a serious public health concern. However, surveillance strategies and monitoring programs must be routinely implemented to ensure minimal mycotoxin contamination of wheat-based products. © 2019 by the authors.},

Using ICP-MS, we quantified the total As ( t As) levels in the main brands of rice (n = 103) and infant cereals (n = 27) consumed by Brazilians. The levels were compared to the maximum limits prescribed by regulatory agencies. We estimated the daily intake (EDI) of As by Brazilians by combining the mean As concentration determined in the white rice samples with per capita daily consumption divided by the average body weight as reported by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 2010. The possible health risk for consumers was assessed by calculating the margin of exposure (MOE) as prescribed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Moreover, t As was determined in 11 pesticides used by Brazilian farmers. The t As levels in the rice ranged from 0.003 to 1.3 mg kg −1 . Approximately 27% of the white rice contained t As levels above the limit set by Mercosul (0.3 mg kg −1 ) and 45% were above the limit set by the European Commission (0.2 mg kg −1 ). In the infant cereals, t As levels ranged from 0.003 to 0.243 mg kg −1 . In the pesticides, t As levels ranged from 0.005 to 0.315 mg L −1 . The EDI showed that, on average, Brazilians consume 4.13 µg As kg −1 BW weekly. In addition, a low MOE was observed, demonstrating that high use of rice presents a risk of high inorganic ( i As) exposure, which represents a public health concern. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {The growth of Aspergillus flavus and the production of aflatoxins (AF) during the aerobic deterioration of corn silage represent a problem for animal and human health. This experiment was conducted to evaluate whether the presence of A. flavus and AF production originate from the field or additional AF are produced during the fermentation phase or during aerobic deterioration of corn silage. The trial was carried out in northern Italy on corn at a dry matter (DM) level of 34%. The fresh herbage was either not treated (C) or treated with a Lactobacillus buchneri (LB) NCIMB 40788 [(at 3 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh matter (FM)], Lactobacillus hilgardii (LH) CNCM 1-4785 (at 3 x 10(5) cfu/g of FM), or their combination (LB+LH; at 1.5 x 10(5) cfu/g of FM of each strain) ensiled in 20-L silos and opened after 250 d of ensiling. After silo opening, the aerobic stability was evaluated and samples were taken after 7 and 14 d of air exposure. The pre-ensiled material, the silages at silo opening, and the aerobically exposed silages were analyzed for DM content, fermentative profiles, microbial count, nutritive characteristics, DM losses, and AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), and AFG(2) contents. Furthermore, a subsample of colonies with macromorphological features of Aspergillus section Flavi was selected for AF gene pattern characterization and in vitro AF production. The presence of A. flavus was below the detection limit (<1.00 log(10) cfu/g) in the fresh forage before ensiling, whereas it was found in 1 out of 16 silage samples at silo opening at a level of 1.24 log(10) cfu/g. The AF were found in both the fresh forage and at opening in all the samples, with a predominance of AFB(2) (mean value of 1.71 mu g/kg of DM). The inoculation of lactic acid bacteria determined a reduction in the lactic-to-acetic ratio compared with the control. A larger amount of acetic acid resulted in a lower yeast count and higher aerobic stability in the treated silages than in the control ones. At the beginning of aerobic deterioration, the yeasts increased to over 5 log(10) cfu/g, whereas the molds were close to the value observed at silo opening. When the inhibiting conditions were depleted (pH and temperature higher than 5 and 35 degrees C, respectively), both the total molds and A. flavus reached higher values than 8.00 and 4.00 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, thus determining the ex novo production of AFB(1) during aerobic deterioration, regardless of treatments. The analysis of gene pattern showed that 64% of the selected colonies of A. flavus showed the presence of all 4 AF gene patterns, and 43% of the selected colonies were able to produce AF in vitro. During air exposure, after 1,000 degrees C.h have been cumulated, starch content decreased (below 10% DM) and concentration of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicelluloses, crude protein, and ash increased. The inoculation with LB and LB+LH increased the aerobic stability of the silages and delayed the onset of aerobic microbial degradation, which in turn indirectly reduced the risk of A. flavus outgrowth and AFB(1) production after silage opening.},

   abstract = {Rice is considered the most main food in Iranian diet. Its chemical contamination with heavy metals can lead to adverse effects to human health. In the present study, 60 imported rice samples from 20 different brands were collected and examined in terms of lead and arsenic levels in Tehran. Besides, point estimation and uncertainty analysis were used to determine the additional risk of carcinogenicity and non-carcinogenicity in raw and as-consumed rice. The results showed that the means of lead and arsenic (mg/kg fresh weight) in raw sampled rice were 0.0352 +/- 0.0398 and 0.106 +/- 0.049, respectively, and they were 0.0226 +/- 0.0360 and 0.0689 +/- 0.046 in as-consumed rice, respectively. Additionally, lead and arsenic amounts were 5% and 15% higher than the value set by Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran respectively, while assessment of the non-carcinogenicity risk of lead and arsenic in point estimation and uncertainty analysis showed the hazard quotient and hazard index values were less than 1 and in safe ranges in both raw and as-consumed rice and were not considered a threat to the public health. The additional risk of arsenic carcinogenicity in point estimation and uncertainty analysis in raw and as-consumed rice samples found higher than the 1E-06 EPA's acceptable level of risk. So, these results could be applicable and encourage researchers to perform more detailed studies with more samples for considering by food authorities.},

   abstract = {This study was conducted to survey the levels of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the main foods of Isfahan province (central Iran). The rice grains and wheat breads were collected from Isfahan city and villages around the Isfahan and Mobarakeh Steel companies. The food samples were wet-ashed by heating in the presence of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The potential exposure risks were then estimated. Levels of Cd in the rice grains and Pb in the investigated foods (except Sangak beard) were above the maximum levels as set by the Codex Alimentarius and National standards of Iran. The wheat bread samples in Isfahan city and Mobarakeh Steel regions presented higher estimated weekly intake (EWI) of Pb (40.93 and 35.35 µg kg–1 body weight, respectively) compared to other foods. The EWI for Cd and Pb in most samples was considerably above than the provisional tolerable weekly intake. In most cases, the target hazard quotients values were above one and consequently the consumption of foods in the investigated regions was a potentially serious health risk caused by exposure to the crops contaminated with Cd and Pb. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This study explored the feasibility of the Raman rapid screening technique for zearalenone in contaminated maize. For representative Raman spectra acquisition, the ground maize samples were collected by extended sample area to avoid the adverse effect of heterogeneous component. Regression models were built with partial least squares (PLS) and compared with those built with other variable selection algorithms such as synergy interval PLS (siPLS), ant colony optimization PLS (ACO-PLS) and siPLS-ACO. SiPLS-ACO algorithm was superior to others in terms of predictive power performance for zearalenone analysis. The best model based on siPLS-ACO achieved coefficients of correlation (R-p) of 0.9260 and RMSEP of 87.9132 mu g/kg in the prediction set, respectively. Raman spectroscopy combined multivariate calibration showed promising results for the rapid screening large numbers of zearalenone maize contaminations in bulk quantities without sample-extraction steps.},

In this study, a total of 67 raw cereals (55 maize and 12 sorghum) were collected from the market of Togo. The samples were investigated on the occurrence of 21 mycotoxins using state-of-the-art high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The most frequent occurring mycotoxins were fumonisins (88 and 67% for maize and sorghum respectively) with concentrations ranging from 101 to 1838 μg/kg for maize and 81.5 to 361 μg/kg for sorghum, respectively. Aflatoxin B1 was detected in 38% of the maize samples with maximum contamination levels of 256 μg/kg, and 25% of the sorghum samples (range 6–16 μg/kg). The concentrations of aflatoxins were high in maize, with some cases exceeding the maximum legislative limits (EU) for unprocessed maize placed on the market. In addition to these high contamination levels, the co-occurrence of three classes of mycotoxins (i.e., aflatoxins, fumonisins, and trichothecenes) was observed in this study. For the first time, the multi-mycotoxins occurrence in agronomical crops in Togo was reported. © 2019, Society for Mycotoxin (Research Gesellschaft für Mykotoxinforschung e.V.) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The mean concentrations of Cd in potatoes, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, leeks, carrots, wheat, and rice samples were measured as 0.022 ± 0.013, 0.011 ± 0.009, 0.003 ± 0.003, 0.007 ± 0.005, 0.015 ± 0.024, 0.013 ± 0.011, 0.046 ± 0.043, and 0.049 ± 0.04 mg kg-1 wet weight, respectively, and all were below the permissible levels established by the European Union. The corresponding values for the estimated daily intake of Cd were acceptable and lower than the provisional tolerable daily intake. The THQ and total THQ values of Cd through consumption of all vegetables and cereals were lower than 1. The margin of exposure values for Pb in samples were >1, showing no significant human health risks for both potentially toxic elements.

   abstract = {Wheat is not only the main grain in China, but also is an important feed and industrial raw material. Wheat is susceptible to scab, which can produce vomitoxin whose scientific name is Deoxynivalenol (DON). Vomitoxin is carcinogenic and pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In recent years, due to the frequent occurrence of extreme and abnormal weather, the risk of DON infection is on the rise, which has become the main factor affecting the quality and safety of wheat products. However, traditional methods for detecting DON content have obvious problems such as cumbersome and time-consuming detection process. Therefore, developing a fast, low-cost and online detection method is of great significance for the safe production and processing of wheat. Firstly, 200 wheat samples with different degrees of scab infection were collected from all parts of Jiangsu. After milling, the content of DON in wheat was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and then the visible/near-infrared spectral of wheat were collected online. The data processing steps are: pre-processing the spectrum by multi-scattering correction and second derivative, and extracting the characteristic wavelength according to the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling algorithm, then using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to establish a qualitative analysis model of wheat flour samples (with a national standard of 1 000 μg•kg-1), and a quantitative analysis model of DON content in wheat flour samples was established according to partial least squares regression (PLSR). UPLC-MS/MS results showed that the risk of wheat DON contamination was higher, and the over-standard rate of the tested samples was 50%. Visible/near-infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the spectral characteristics of different DON content wheat samples had some differences. The original spectrum and the second derivative spectrum showed that the higher the DON content, the lower the absorbance at 1 420 nm. Due to the low absolute content of DON and the limited detection limit of spectroscopy, the obvious clustering trend could not be found by principal component analysis. However, the LDA and PLS-DA discriminant models constructed according to the full spectrum and the characteristic spectrum can quickly identify and screen sound and infection samples, and the best recognition rate was 87.69%. According to the quantitative analysis results, the PLSR model of DON content in wheat samples was not ideal. The optimal model results: the correlation coefficient (rp) of the prediction set was 0.688, the root mean square error (RMSEP) was 727 μg•kg-1, and the relative analysis deviation (RPD) was 1.38. The accuracy and robustness of the model needed to be further improved. It is feasible to use visible/near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics methods to achieve on-line discrimination and screening of wheat DON content exceeding the standard, which provides a technical reference for the rapid and quality detection of wheat products in China. However, the quantitative analysis of DON content needs further research to explore the influence of external factors on the model, and it is planned to expand the sample size, collect wheat samples from different regions and different varieties, and improve the accuracy and universality of the model. © 2019, Peking University Press.

   abstract = {Without enforced standards or reliable third-party verification, food safety threats such as pesticide residues and aflatoxin contamination are generally unobservable or only partially observable to both buyers and sellers, especially of staple foods in rural maize markets in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, sellers have more information about food quality than do buyers. Such information asymmetries can impede market development and undermine human health. We study farm household behaviour in the context of imperfect food safety information. We pool observations obtained from 707 food storage containers maintained by 309 farm households in Benin, surveyed following the maize harvests of 2011/2012 and 2013/2014. Our results indicate that when a household perceives a food safety risk associated with application of insecticides, on average it is 33 percentage points less likely to apply insecticides to maize it intends to consume than it is to maize it intends to sell. These individuals are also more likely to sell maize than households without food safety concerns. Results highlight the potential value of improved storage technologies and quality control to promote market transactions and reduce hidden health risks. © 2019 The Authors.

The risk of exposure to the tested mycotoxins, following the consumption of beer in Poland, was assessed. The corresponding probable daily intakes (PDIs) remained a small fraction of the tolerable daily intake (TDI). However, in the improbable worst-case scenario, in which every beer bottle consumed would be contaminated with mycotoxins present at the highest level observed among the analyzed beer samples, the PDI would exceed the TDI for DON and its metabolite after the consumption of a single bottle (0.5 L) of beer. © 2019 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Human exposure to arsenic (As) through the consumption of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a worldwide health concern. In this paper, we evaluated the major causes for high inorganic As levels in cooked rice foods, and the potential of post-harvesting and cooking options for decreasing inorganic As content in cooked rice, focusing particularly on As endemic areas. The key factors for high As concentration in cooked rice in As endemic areas are: (1) rice cultivation on As-contaminated paddy soils; (2) use of raw rice grains which exceed 200 μg kg−1 of inorganic As to cook rice; and (3) use of As-contaminated water for cooking rice. In vitro and in vivo methods can provide useful information regarding the bioaccessibility of As in the gastrointestinal tract. Urinary levels of As can also be used as a valid measure of As exposure in humans. Polishing of raw rice grains has been found to be a method to decrease total As content in cooked rice. Sequential washing of raw rice grains and use of an excess volume of water for cooking also decrease As content in cooked rice. The major concern with those methods (i.e. polishing of raw rice, sequential washing of raw rice, and use of excess volume of water for cooking rice) is the decreased nutrient content in the cooked rice. Cooking rice in percolating water has recently gained significant attention as a way to decrease As content in cooked rice. Introducing and promoting rainwater harvesting systems in As endemic areas may be a sustainable way of reducing the use of As-contaminated water for cooking purposes. In conclusion, post-harvesting methods and changes in cooking practices could reduce As content in cooked rice to a greater extent. Research gaps and directions for future studies in relation to different post-harvesting and cooking practices, and rainwater harvesting systems are also discussed in this review. © 2019},

The developed BAS-MBI had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.098 ng mL−1, with half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.71 ng mL−1 in working buffer, and an LOD of 0.98 ng g−1; the detection range was from 0.98 to 51.6 ng g−1 in authentic agricultural samples. The BAS-MBI has been demonstrated to be a powerful method for the rapid, sensitive, specific, and accurate determination of ZEN. The ZEN positivity rate reached the highest level of 40.6% in 133 samples in 2016; ZEN levels ranged from 1.8 to 1100.0 ng g−1, with an average level of 217.9 ng g−1. In 2017, the ZEN positivity rate was the lowest at 24.5% in 143 samples; ZEN levels ranged from 1.1 to 722.6 ng g−1, with an average of 166.7 ng g−1. In 2018, the ZEN positivity rate was 31.8% in 129 samples; ZEN levels ranged from 1.3 to 947.8 ng g−1, with an average of 157.0 ng g−1. About 20% of ZEN-positive samples exceeded maximum limit levels. An alternative method of ZEN detection and a valuable reference for ZEN contamination in corn and its related products in China are provided. This survey suggests the need for prevention of serious ZEN contamination, along with management for food safety and human health. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Aflatoxin and fumonisin are two major foodborne mycotoxins: toxic chemicals produced by fungi that contaminate food commodities including maize, a staple food in sub-Saharan Africa. Aflatoxin causes liver cancer, and is associated with acute liver toxicity and immunotoxicity; while fumonisin is associated with neural tube defects in infants and esophageal cancer. Both mycotoxins have been associated with child growth impairment. Previous studies suggest that co-occurrence of these mycotoxins may have potentially synergistic toxicological effects. Despite health risks associated with co-occurrence of these mycotoxins, no study has examined their co-occurrence along key food supply chains in Africa. This study is the first report that examines the occurrence and co-occurrence of aflatoxins and fumonisins along the maize value chain in Nigeria. All samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. About 52% and 21% of the samples had aflatoxin levels above the Nigerian and US standards for human food, respectively. Though no regulatory limits exist for fumonisin in Nigeria, 13% of the samples contained fumonisin levels higher than the US regulatory limit. Aflatoxin levels can become dangerously high in maize stored four months or longer. Adequately addressing mycotoxin risk requires consideration of the entire maize value chain and associated value chains for food production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND High levels of harmful pesticide residues in rice can cause undesirable side effects and are a source of great concern to consumers. Reduction of pesticide residues to provide rice security has thus became an urgent problem. RESULTS In this study, the effects of commercial and home processing on removal of chlorpyrifos and carbosulfan residues from rice, and the formation of metabolites during processing, were studied. The results showed that 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (0.87 mg kg(-1)) and carbofuran (0.43 mg kg(-1)) were the predominant components detected in paddy rice. All detected residues were primarily deposited on the rice hull and bran. Washing twice followed by high-pressure cooking was able to further decrease residues in polished rice with the processing factor value <0.25. Following application of pesticides at the recommended rate and twice the recommended rate, with a preharvest interval of 28 days, changes in residues from harvest to dining table based on efficient processing techniques were investigated. The final residues dropped to below maximum residue levels after washing twice followed by high-pressure cooking. CONCLUSION This simple cooking process thus reduces the risk of dietary exposure, and it is recommended that it is adopted by all consumers. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

A high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) was validated and used to determine aflatoxins in 246 samples. Dietary exposure was calculated by estimated daily intake (EDI), whereas risk characterization was assessed using the risk of cancer and margin of exposure (MOE) approaches. The method showed good selectivity, linearity (R2 &gt; 0.9993), limit of detection (LOD = 0.004–0.014 ng mL−1), limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.014–0.046 ng mL−1), accuracy (2.40%–14.1%), and recovery (58%–110%). Aflatoxins were detected in 38.6% of the samples at levels between 0.08 and 41.75 μg kg−1, and 11.4% of the samples contaminated with AFB1 exceeded the limit (2 μg kg−1) established by the European Commission (EC). The EDI of aflatoxins due to the consumption of arepa (0.732) and rice (3.093) were above the recommended level of 0.017 ng kg−1 bw day−1. Also, the estimated number of liver cancer cases associated with AFB1 exposure due to arepa (0.726) and rice (3.314) consumption was above the suggested limit of 0.1 cases/75 years/100,000 individuals. Finally, the MOEs obtained by arepa and rice consumption were 277.5 and 60.79, respectively, far from the safe margin of 10,000, thereby indicating a potential risk to public health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Sorghum has gained popularity with consumers as a grain source with its gluten-free and high protein dietary characteristics. Acreage has increased recently, in part due to the demand for an alternative feed source for poultry and swine. New information is needed about the level of mycotoxin contamination in sorghum accessions, and accurate and affordable analytical methods need to be developed and tested to quantify mycotoxins in sorghum. A traditional method (solid-phase extraction chromatography with C18, followed by GC-MS) to quantify the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) produced inconsistent DON values following controlled spiking and recovery experiments with different sorghum accessions. Consequently, we incorporated a stable isotope (d1-DON) as an internal standard into a traditional GC-MS method. This method, stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA), was used to accurately determine DON levels in 196 sorghum samples representing 98 different accessions. Of the 98 accessions tested (two samples per accession), 76 of the accessions had DON levels that were greater than the limit of detection for both methods (0.20 μg g−1). For a USA regulatory threshold of 1 μg g−1, about one third of all the accessions (26/76) had at least 20% more DON using the SIDA method. For a regulatory threshold of 5 μg g−1, about 7% of all the accessions (5/76) had at least 20% more DON using the SIDA method. Using SIDA, the amount of DON in a sorghum sample can be accurately and reliably quantitated by basing calculations on the recovery of d1-DON, and this method may have future applications for quantifying DON from samples with complex matrices. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Fifteen samples had aflatoxin concentrations ranging from 10 to 171g/kg, mean 54.4g/kg; four samples were outliers. Since Guyanese consume mainly white and parboiled rice, composite samples were taken along the marketing chain at points of sale to determine the presence of AFs. Of the sixty samples of white rice collected, 6.7% (4) had AF concentrations greater than the EUC regulatory limits ranging from 31.9 to 131g/kg, mean 80.8g/kg.

   abstract = {Background: Cereal and cereal-based products are used as an important sources of energy and minerals as well as vitamins in all of the world. However, their contamination with mycotoxins reserved huge concerns due to adverse effects of mycotoxin on human health. Scope and approach: The present research was undertaken to evaluate published studies regarding the identification of mycotoxins zearalenone (ZEN), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), and total aflatoxin (TAF) in the cereal-based products between 1 January 1983 and 25 December 2017. In this regard, 66 out of 2817 screened studies were used in the conducted systematic review. Key findings and conclusions: The lowest and highest number of published reports was associated with DON and TAF in some of the cereal-based products, respectively. Among the countries, Germany was ranked as the first in establishing investigations. Moreover, the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) was categorized as the most implemented technique for mycotoxin detection. The rank order of products cereal-based food based on number of studies was cereal grains > cornflake > bread > breakfast > flour > infant product > pasta > other products. The results of this study not only summarized the most frequently mycotoxin detection technique but also may provide a roadmap for future research regarding the mycotoxins detection analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: The current meta-analysis study was aimed to estimate the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) contamination in cereal grains and their products such as wheat, rice, corn, maize, barley, oat, peas, soybean, cornflakes, and breakfast. Scope and approach: The recommended databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases, were investigated to collect data regarding the PTEs contamination in cereal-based products from 1 January 1983 to 30 May 2019. Key findings and conclusions: Among 1401 retrieved citations in the identification step, 45 articles were included in the conducted meta-analysis. In this context, the overall rank order of PTEs mean concentration in the cereal foods was Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > Cr > Cd > As > Pb > Sn > Hg. The results of the current study showed that processing has a strong effect on the reduction of PTEs except in the case of Zn and Sn. The concentration of Cu, Cd, Pb, Fe, Hg and Mn in wheat was higher than corn and rice. The amount of Zn and As in rice was greater than wheat and corn while the concentration of Ni and Cr in corn was higher than wheat and rice. The findings of this meta-analysis may be useful for the building of risk assessment models aiming to derive data for the development of specific actions to reduce exposure to PTEs through the consumption of the cereal-based products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The extraction method carried out with a Romer Mycosep 226 column was found to be efficient due to addition of both diatomaceous earth and centrifuging during the cleaning step. From the total of 84 analyzed samples, 78.6% (n = 66) were found to be contaminated ZEA at levels between 15.4 and 72.1 μg/kg. This study was the first report on occurrence of positive samples for ZEA in corn meal commercialized in Parana since 2005. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of ZEA for the Brazilian population and for the State of Parana was 3.1 and 2.2 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. The EDI was below the tolerable daily intake of 250 ng/kg bw/day. Despite the low health risk of the population, it was observed that the occurrence of ZEA in corn meal was frequent, which demonstrates the importance of monitoring studies to ensure consumer's health. Practical applications: Occurrence of zearalenone in corn meal was high (78.6%) in Brazil. First report on corn meal samples positive for zearalenone in Paraná, Brazil. No sample exceeded the tolerated limit by both Brazilian and European legislation. EDI due to corn meal consumption was inferior to TDI. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Four different types of breads and two types of flour samples with high distribution were taken from market and their residues of pesticides were measured. A simple dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) method with solidification of floating organic drop was developed for the measurement. The health risk of these pesticides on adults and children health was assessed by target hazard quotient (THQ) using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. About, 15% and 11.1% of total samples contained detectable levels of deltamethrin and malathion, respectively. None of the tested samples showed any permethrin residue. The results from all samples showed that none of the pesticides exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). About 85% of pesticide residue detections were observed in tropical and mild weather area which is due to high consumption rate of insecticides in these areas. The percentile 95% of THQ is due to bread ingestion content of deltamethrin which was 0.033 and 0.070 for the adults and children, respectively, while this value for malathion was found to be, 0.015 and 0.030, respectively. In the adults and children for both deltamethrin and malathion, the percentile 95% of THQ value were lower than 1 (acceptable level). The non-carcinogenic health risk assessment indicated that bread consumers in Kermanshah province are not at a considerable risk because of deltamethrin and malathion. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The present study was conducted to assess the concentrations of chromium, nickel, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and lead in rice and vegetables and their possible human health risks in Tangail district, Bangladesh. Metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion system. The average values of Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb in rice and vegetables were 16.26, 16.11, 13.99, 2.28, 1.86, and 7.93 mg/kg, respectively. The average metal concentration in rice and vegetable species was in the decreasing order of okra &gt; chili &gt; bitter gourd &gt; papaya &gt; brinjal &gt; bean &gt; bottle gourd &gt; rice &gt; cucumber &gt; sponge gourd &gt; Indian spinach. The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of all the metals except Cu were higher than the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). The target hazard quotients (THQs) values of Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb exceeded the threshold value of 1 through consumption of rice and vegetables, indicating significant health risks to both adult and children. The target carcinogenic risk (TR) of As and Pb through consumption of rice and vegetables was higher than the USEPA threshold level (10−4). From the health point of view, this study clearly revealed that consumption of these contaminated rice and vegetables definitely poses carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium species, is a widespread and destructive fungal disease. In addition to the substantial yield and revenue losses, diseased grains are often contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins, making them unsuitable for human consumption or use as animal feed. As a vital food and feed ingredient in China, the quality and safety of wheat and its products have gained growing attention from consumers, producers, scientists, and policymakers. This review supplies detailed data about the occurrence of Fusarium toxins and related intoxications from the 1980s to the present. Despite the serious situation of toxin contamination in wheat, the concentration of toxins in flour is usually lower than that in raw materials, and food-poisoning incidents have been considerably reduced. Much work has been conducted on every phase of toxin production and wheat circulation by scientific researchers. Regulations for maximum contamination limits have been established in recent years and play a substantial role in ensuring the stability of the national economy and people's livelihoods.},

In this study, risk of total aflatoxin based on its exposure levels and adverse effects was assessed in Iranian rice. Materials &amp; Methods: This study was carried out on total aflatoxin in 60 national rice samples collected based on the Food Safety and Nutrition regions. The risk score was assessed in each region and through the country using quantitative risk assessment method based on the estimated exposure, provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI), carcinogenic slip factor (CSF) in the two groups of HBAg+ and HBAg- and effects of various cooking methods. Results: The mean and standard deviation of the total aflatoxin content in rice samples included 1.13 and 1.8 μg/kg, respectively. Results of the exposure assessment in terms of minimum, average and maximum concentrations of the contaminants and the consumption volume in each region for the two groups of HBAg+ and HBAg- showed that the highest risk score was linked to rice cooking method in rural areas of relatively unsafe regions and in HBAg+ group. Conclusion: Despite a high-risk score volume of the rice consumption in Iran, results have shown that the total aflatoxin in rice is lower than the maximum eligible limit by the Iranian National Standard (30 μg/kg); therefore, total aflatoxin contamination of the rice in Iran includes no risks to the health of consumers. © 2020, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute.

The results showed that the rinsed cooking has higher efficiency for removal of toxic metals (As = 42.3%, Pb = 42.9% and = 27.6%) than Kateh method (As = 26.9%, Pb = 26.9% and = 20.9%). Additionally, by increasing of rice soaking time from 1 to 12 h, the toxic metals removal was increased up to 37.1%, 42.6% and 16.6% for As, Pb and Cd, respectively. Although the toxic metals reduction was such that the non-carcinogenic risk was regarded as acceptable level after all processes, for arsenic, these reductions did not lower the carcinogenic risk to an acceptable level.

International and Iranian national databases were searched carefully with appropriate keywords for papers on toxic metal contamination of rice from Agust-2000 to Agust-2018. Initially, 560 articles were found, of which only the 50 papers fit the inclusion criteria and were selected for further analysis. The Monte Carlo Simulation was applied to generate missing data (mean, standard deviation, data distribution and sample size) of toxic metal concentration in some papers. Then, statistical analysis, health risk assessment, and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed. The results indicated that approximately 88% of rice consumed in Iran (including Iranian, Pakistani and Indian rice) do not meet the national standard and WHO/FAO guideline requirements and their related health risks are unacceptable. The risks of arsenic and lead in Indian rice and cadmium in Iranian rice were considerably higher than others. In conclusion, according to our findings, In conclusion, it is necessary to prevent toxic metals contamination of rice by modifying cultivation patterns and, also, prevent low-quality rice brands to be imported. © 2019},

   abstract = {The fumonisins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that have been implicated in various adverse human health effects. Recently, the Codex Alimentarius Commission set maximum levels (MLs) for fumonisin mycotoxins at 4000 μg/kg for raw maize and 2000 μg/kg for maize flour and maize meal and these have been incorporated into South African health regulations. The MLs are intended to be health protective such that fumonisin exposures will be below the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of fumonisin of 2 μg/kg body weight/day set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). South Africa has an extensive commercial maize farming industry as well as a large subsistence farming population reliant on home-grown maize. The available data on fumonisin contamination levels indicates that these MLs are readily met by the commercial crop. However, the situation in subsistence farming areas such as in the Eastern Cape Province region is of concern. The daily consumption of large amounts of highly fumonisin-contaminated home-grown maize is of relevance mainly due to rudimentary milling, which is not subject to the reduction in mycotoxin contamination associated with commercial milling. Analysis of historical fumonisin data from the Eastern Cape region indicates that approximately 12.8% of raw maize and 25% of the rural locally produced flour would not meet the respective MLs of 4000 μg/kg ML and 2000 μg/kg. Further analysis shows that given the high maize intake levels of this population, only prohibitively low MLs for raw maize of around 100–300 μg/kg would be health protective for different age groups in this area. Based on this analysis, the lowering of fumonisin exposure in subsistence farmers requires an integrated approach and cannot be achieved purely by regulatory means. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of mycotoxins in industry-submitted cool-season barley and wheat grown under low heat unit climate conditions. Seventy-two barley samples and 83 wheat samples were submitted by producers and industry from May 2016 to May 2017. The concentrations of twelve common mycotoxins, including nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN), α-zearalenol (α-ZAL), β-zearalenol (β-ZAL), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), T-2 toxin (T-2), HT-2 toxin (HT-2), and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), were determined using the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. Mycotoxins were detected in 40 barley (56%) and 35 wheat (42%) samples submitted by producers and industry. DON showed the highest incidence in barley (44%) and wheat (33%). None of the barley samples contained detectable DAS and no wheat samples tested positive for α-ZAL, DAS, T-2, or AFB1. Co-occurrence of DON and other mycotoxins was frequently observed. Among the mycotoxin-positive samples, 70% of barley samples and 54% of wheat samples were co-contaminated with at least two mycotoxins. Four barley (6%) and five wheat (6%) samples contained levels of DON above 1000 µg/kg (regulatory level in diets for lactating dairy animals) and HT-2 content in five barley (7%) and four wheat (5%) samples exceeded 100 µg/kg (regulatory level in diets for cattle and poultry). Overall, contamination of these mycotoxins was more frequent and more severe in barley in comparison with wheat that was submitted by producers and industry. Comprehensive strategies, including the prevention of Fusarium toxins contamination, the routine monitoring of their prevalence, the detoxification of them in feed and food, as well as the inhibition of their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, are highly required. A rapid detection method needs to be developed to screen mycotoxins in industry-submitted cool-season cereal grains. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Globally, mycotoxins in food and feed are serious threats to the health of human and animals. Ergot alkaloids (EAs) are frequently detected in barley as well as other cereals. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of applying NIR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy for the determination of major EAs in cool-season barley samples grown under cold climate condition in western Canada. Sixty-seven cool-season barley samples were collected from Western Canada and analyzed for six major EAs by LC-MS/MS technique. Forty-nine barley samples were positive for EAs. The mean concentrations of ergocornine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergometrine, ergosine, ergotamine, and the sum-total EAs in positive barley samples were 120.9, 554.8, 235.6, 411.0, 127.4, 351.2, and 1150.5 mu g/kg, respectively. The NIR (680-2500 nm) and MIR (4000-700 cm(-1)) spectra of cool season barley samples were collected and calibrated with EAs reference values using PLS regression technique based on different spectral preprocessing methods and selected wavelengths. Results showed that most of the constructed models obtained weak calibration and cross-validation parameters and none of the models was able to accurately predict external samples. The relatively low levels of EAs in the contaminated barley samples might be lower than the detection limit of the conventional MR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy. More efforts are needed to study the determination limit of molecular spectroscopic techniques in detecting EAs in cereal grain grown under the cold climate condition.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of mycotoxins is often increased by climatic conditions prevailing in tropical regions. Therefore, consumers in tropical countries such as Thailand have a higher risk of mycotoxin exposure. Existing reports have revealed mycotoxin contamination in rice. This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of multiple mycotoxins in barley and nine types of rice sold in Thailand and to assess consumer health risk. A total of 300 samples collected from various markets in Thailand were analyzed for the presence of 16 mycotoxins using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) procedure and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Of the 300 samples, 124 (41.33%) were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin, and 38.71% of the mycotoxin-positive samples were simultaneously contaminated with more than one toxin. The incidence of mycotoxin contamination differed among the rice and barley samples. Beauvericin, diacetoxyscirpenol, zearalenone, and aflatoxins were the most frequently found mycotoxins. However, the concentrations of regulated mycotoxins were below the regulatory limits. The assessed mycotoxin exposure does not represent a health risk for Thai consumers because the estimated exposure concentrations were lower than the tolerable daily intake values established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. However, our findings suggest that continued monitoring of mycotoxin contamination in rice and barley and concomitant risk assessments are warranted. HIGHLIGHTS • Contamination with multiple mycotoxins was found in rice and barley. • BEA, DAS, ZEA, and aflatoxins were the mycotoxins most frequently found in samples. • The assessed mycotoxin exposure does not represent a health risk for consumers. © International Association for Food Protection.},

Moreover, the level of contamination of domestic organic cereals was compared with that of imported ones. To this end, the level of contamination by heavy metals (Pb, Cd), nitrates, trace elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Ni, Co) and mycotoxins (aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin, and T-2) were reported. Seventy-six organic cereals and derived products of domestic and imported origin were tested including rice, barley, oat, wheat, maize and two samples made of a mixture of grains. The levels of contamination were calculated and compared to the recommended or regulated maximum levels. The maximum levels were exceeded for lead (2), cadmium (1), aflatoxins (4), and ochratoxin (1). Contamination of samples by nitrate was below the allowed level. The level of contamination in domestic organic samples was similar to that of imported ones, except for cadmium with imported samples being more contaminated. The findings of this study are important in terms of risk to human health, but they do not support nor reject the hypothesis that organic cereals are less contaminated than the conventional ones. © 2019, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).},

This study was conducted to (i) determine Cd concentrations in rice collected from households in the area, (ii) assess the Cd exposure and potential health risk (HQ) from rice consumption in local adults and (iii) investigate how the factors of individual characteristics and consumption behavior affect the level of HQ. A total of 159 rice samples were collected from households in all 6 villages of the Mae Tao sub-district for analysis of Cd by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Biodata information and rice consumption behavior were surveyed from local residents at the same time as rice sample collection. Approximately 19.8% and 19.1% of white rice and sticky rice, respectively, contained total Cd higher than the Codex maximum standard of Cd in rice (0.4 mg kg−1). Locally grown rice contained an average of 1.5 times more Cd than retail rice. Cd exposure from consuming only sticky rice was the highest (2.26 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1), followed by the consumption of both types of rice (1.39 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1) and the consumption of only white jasmine rice (6.30 × 10−4 mg kg−1 day−1). The highest and lowest average HQ values were found in the only sticky rice consumption pattern (2.263) and the only white rice consumption pattern (0.630), respectively. The potential health risk from Cd in each rice consumption pattern was mainly influenced by the total Cd concentration in rice and the rice ingestion rate. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

All known 17 peer-reviewed studies, published in databases included in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, as well as grey literature published in Google Scholar from 2008 to 2017 were considered. The 95th and 50th centiles of Hazard Index (HI) in Iranians due to ingestion of rice were estimated to be 2.5 and 0.5, respectively. The 95th and 50th centiles of people with positive surface antigens for hepatitis B (HBsAg+) risk characterisation for AFB1 in Iranian consumers of rice were 81 and 79.1, respectively. The 95th and 50th centiles for risks of Iranians negative for the surface antigen of hepatitis B HBsAg (HBsAg-) were 4.4 and 2.6, respectively. Based on results of the MCS for risks to cancer effects, the 95th and 50th centiles of margins of exposure (MOE) were 233 and 231, respectively.

In this study, domestic milled rice processed by actors using suboptimal methods was purchased and total fumonisin (FUM), zearalenone, and aflatoxin concentrations determined at 0, 90, and 180 days after storage. Three different climatic locations, Cotonou (Benin) in the Guinea savanna, Yaoundé (Cameroon) in the Tropical forest, and N'diaye (Senegal) in the Sahel, were selected as storage sites. Subsets of the samples collected from Glazoue (Benin), Ndop (Cameroon), and Dagana (Senegal) were stored in plastic woven bags under room conditions in the respective sites with or without calcium oxide (burnt scallop shell—BSS, 0.1% w/w) treatment. Multivariance analysis showed that FUM concentration was positively influenced by the duration of storage only while zearalenone concentration was negatively influenced by relative humidity and head rice but positively by impurities. Zearalenone concentration was also influenced by sample collection/storage location, processing type, and duration of storage. Aflatoxin concentration was influenced negatively by storage room temperature and head rice but positively by impurities and chalky grains. In addition, aflatoxin concentration was influenced by collection/storage location and processing type. BSS treatment followed by storage for 6 months had no effect on the concentration of the three assessed mycotoxins. Strategies to reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination in study sites will include the improvement of physical rice quality through better pre- and postharvest practices and proper packaging of both treated rice and untreated rice in hermetic systems before marketing and storage. © 2019 The Authors.

Prevention or control of wheat diseases may have an enormous impact on global food security and safety. Fusarium head blight is an economically debilitating disease of wheat that reduces the quantity and quality of grain harvested, and may lead to contamination with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, which affects the health of humans and domesticated animals. Current climate change scenarios predict an increase in the number of epidemics caused by this disease. Multiple strategies are available for managing the disease including cultural practices, planting less-susceptible cultivars, crop rotation, and chemical and biological controls. None of these strategies, however, is completely effective by itself, and an integrated approach incorporating multiple controls simultaneously is the only effective strategy to limit the disease and reduce deoxynivalenol contamination in human food and animal feed chains.

   abstract = {Arsenic (As) in rice grains is a serious food safety concern. Some coexisting engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) were shown to alter the accumulation and speciation of As in rice grains. However, investigation on the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs), a popular ingredient in pesticides, on the uptake and accumulation of As is rare. We explored the potentially different impact of CuO NPs and corresponding Cu(II) ions on the accumulation of two As species in rice seedlings in a hydroponic system. Rice seedlings were treated with a combinations of 1 mg/L of arsenite (As(III)) or arsenate (As(V)) and 100 mg/L of CuO NPs or Cu(II) for 6 days. Both forms of Cu significantly reduced the accumulation of total As in rice tissues, with Cu(II) exhibiting significantly greater effect than CuO NPs. As speciation in rice roots was markedly affected by both forms of Cu, and the impacts were Cu-form dependent. For example, the co-existence of As(V) with CuO NPs led to a 45% decrease of As(V) in rice roots, while the co-existence of As(V) with Cu(II) caused a 47% increase in As(V) in rice roots. As speciation in rice shoots was less affected by co-present Cu than in rice roots. Co-occurring As(III) or As(V) lowered Cu concentration in rice roots by 40% and 50% in treatments with CuO NPs, but did not affect Cu content in rice roots co-exposed to Cu(II). The study confirmed the reciprocal effect of co-occurring CuO NPs or Cu(II) and As in rice paddies and highlighted the unique “nano-effect” of CuO NPs. The results alsos showed that the initial oxidation state of As plays an important role in the interactions between As and Cu. The results shed light on the current debate on the safe applications of nano-enabled agrichemicals vs. conventional metal salts in agriculture. CuO NPs and Cu(II) ions displayed significant but form-dependent impacts on As accumulation in rice tissues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, two Oryza sativa variants, a hybrid (BG358), a traditional (Suwandel) variety, and a leafy green vegetable crop, Ipomoea aquatica, were exposed under laboratory conditions to natural blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa sampled from a hypereutrophic lake contaminated with MC-LR (3,197.37 ± 1.04 µg/L). Field samples of O. sativa and I. aquatica were collected from farmlands that had been irrigated from a reservoir, containing MC-LR (180 µg/L). MC-LR was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography followed by photodiode-array detection (HPLC-PDA). From the laboratory study, we calculated the potential human health exposure from BG358, Suwandel and I. aquatica as 2.84 ± 0.01, 0.22 ± 0.01, and 0.06 ± 0.01 µg/kg of body weight/day, respectively, whereas the potential health exposures from BG358, Suwandel and I. aquatica collected from the field were 0.10 ± 0.01, 0.009 ± 0.005, and 0.03 ± 0.01 µg/kg of body weight/day, respectively. In certain instances, the results exceeded the World Health Organization’s (WHO) tolerable daily intake of MC-LR, posing a potential health risk to humans. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of continuous screening programs for cyanotoxins in edible plants in the future to prevent the consumption of contaminated crops. © 2019 by the authors.

   abstract = {Methylmercury (MeHg) in rice has attracted growing health concern over the past decade, due to the accumulation of high MeHg levels, which may pose potential health risk to humans. Rice is the staple food in Sri Lanka; nevertheless, the presence of micro pollutants, such as MeHg has been not investigated. Therefore, commercial rice samples from the Sri Lankan market (n = 163) were measured to reveal the total mercury (THg) and MeHg levels. THg (mean: 1.73 +/- 0.89 ng/g, range: 0.21-6.13 ng/g) and MeHg concentrations (mean: 0.51 +/- 0.37 ng/g; range: 0.03-3.81 ng/g) were low. Compared to the fish MeHg exposure, the rice MeHg exposure was generally lower in different consumption groups, suggesting that rice plays a less role than fish in MeHg exposure in Sri Lanka. Babies (infants and toddlers) at one year old may face fish MeHg exposure (0.17 mu g/kg bw/day) higher than the reference dose for MeHg (RfD)-0.1 mu g/kg bw/day, which was more than 5 times that of rice MeHg exposure (0.031 mu g/kg bw/day). Future studies in Sri Lanka should focus on health impacts under long-term overexposure of MeHg, especially in vulnerable populations. Some diet changes should be made to mitigate MeHg exposure levels in Sri Lankans. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

DON were the most widespread mycotoxins (63%), followed by FB1 (57%) and ZEN (46%). 78% of the samples was contaminated with at least one of these mycotoxins. Risk assessment indicated that maize and maize-derived food intake does not pose a potential risk for general adult population with respect to individual mycotoxin. However, two or more mycotoxins were detected in 60% of all samples, and a combination of up to seven different mycotoxins was found. A particular attention should be paid to the combined exposure of mycotoxins, in this cases the estimated daily intake might increase greatly due to the high frequency of co-occurrence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {The co-occurrence of food contaminants has caught the public concern worldwide owing to their extensive distribution and the potential risk on human health. In this study, a total of 6471 samples of cereals and cereal-based products was collected from Shanghai between 2008 and 2011. The food contaminants co-occurred, including mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A), pesticides (organic phosphorus pesticides and methyl bromide), heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and inorganic arsenic), and food additives (aluminum and food pigments), were analyzed for their contents. The point evaluation and probabilistic evaluation based on the Monte Carlo model were performed to assess the risks of the contaminants. The results showed the mean levels of all the tested contaminants were lower than the maximum residue levels (MRLs) set by China, except aluminum, exceeding China MRLs of 100 mg/kg in 2010 and 2011. The point evaluation showed the mean daily exposures (40.7-63.9 ng/kg bw/day) of ochratoxin A in 2010 for different consumer groups were higher than the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of 17 ng/kg bw/day recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Meanwhile, the mean daily exposures of the tested contaminants in each year for 7-to-10-year old children were higher than those for adults. The probabilistic evaluation indicated that the margin of safety (MOS) values of the tested contaminants at percentile 95th (P95) were lower than 1, except aluminum, suggesting the potential health risk of aluminum intake to the consumer groups in Shanghai. Additionally, the risk ranking of these contaminants in cereals and cereal-based products was obtained as follows: aluminum > deoxynivalenol > ochratoxin A > inorganic arsenic > cadmium > lead > chlorpyrifos-methyl > malathion.},

   abstract = {The main safety issue of cereal grains is mycotoxin contamination. There is no published information about mycotoxin contamination of organic wheat in the United States. This study quantified the contents of deoxynivalenol (DON) and ochratoxin A (OTA), two frequently occurring mycotoxins, in organic wheat samples collected from six counties in North Carolina by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By ELISA, all samples were DON and OTA positive, and the DON contents in the flour and bran samples were 0.7-2.35 ppm and 5-8 ppm, respectively, while OTA in the flour and bran samples were 9.54-25.55 ppb and 21.67-32.55 ppb, respectively. By HPLC, the DON detected in flour and bran were 0.24-0.47 ppm and 0.35-0.83 ppm, respectively; all flour samples were OTA negative, but 5 out of 6 bran samples were OTA positive (0.48-1.28 ppb). More studies with larger sample number are needed to obtain representative results. Practical applications This study provides preliminary results about the DON and OTA in organic wheat grains. The results indicate that the organic wheat produced in North Carolina during 2018 season were contaminated by DON and OTA to various degrees. However, the concentrations of these two mycotoxins determined by ELISA were significantly higher than those determined by HPLC. Therefore, to avoid overestimation or underestimation, it is important for researchers and regulatory agencies to conduct multi-lab studies to develop and standardize analytical methods and detailed procedures for accurate DON and OTA quantification. Regardless of analytical methods, all bran samples showed higher DON and OTA concentrations than flour samples. Thus, when using organic wheat bran or whole wheat as food or feed ingredients, the level of bran inclusion should be controlled to protect consumers and animals from mycotoxicosis.},

   abstract = {A study was carried out to evaluate the dissipation kinetics of field-applied omethoate during wheat storage. Both the identification and metabolic dynamics of omethoate metabolites were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF/MS. The presence of the metabolite dimethyl phosphate (DMP) was confirmed in wheat samples with applied omethoate. This might be because the group attached to the P atom of omethoate is replaced by a hydroxyl group through hydrolysis, thus leading to the formation of the specific metabolite DMP during wheat storage. Although the initial concentrations of DMP in different doses were considerably lower than those of omethoate, the half-life values of DMP were 11.87-31.50 days, which were close to the half-life of the parent omethoate (11.85-30.94 days). This indicates that potential health risks might be caused by dietary exposure to DMP and omethoate. Therefore, more importance should be given to the risk assessment for omethoate and its metabolite DMP in wheat.},

Their toxicity was evaluated, and health-based guidance values established on the basis of both Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations. This study presents the results of fumonisin analyses in different maize- and rice-based food products in Hungary and the potential health risk arising from their dietary intake. In total, 326 samples were measured in 2017 and 2018 to determine fumonisins B1 and B2 levels. Three-day dietary record data were collected from 4992 consumers, in 2009. For each food category, the average concentration values were multiplied by the relevant individual consumption data, and the results were compared to the reference values. With respect to the maximum limits, one maize flour, two maize grits, and two samples of other maize-based, snack-like products had total fumonisin content minimally exceeding the EU regulatory limit. The mean daily intake for all maize-product consumers was 0.045-0.120 μg/kg bw/day. The high intake (95 percentile) ranged between 0.182 and 0.396 μg/kg bw/day, well below the 1 μg/kg bw/day tolerable daily intake (TDI) established by EFSA. While the intake calculations resulted in comforting results, maize-based products may indeed be contaminated by fumonisins. Therefore, frequent monitoring of fumonisins' levels and evaluation of their intakes using the best available data are recommended. © 2019 by the authors.},

To assess exposure and health risks of 9 mycotoxins, we employed a multiple immunoaffinity column - high performance liquid chromatography method to determine their concentrations of 35 whole wheat flour and 50 refined wheat flour samples from China. The recoveries of the validated method were 75.78-118.24%, and the limits of detection and quantification were 1.5-20 and 5.0-60 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Multiple mycotoxins were detected in 37.1% of whole wheat flour and 8% of refined wheat flour. In the worst-case scenario, the hazard index was 222.69% for male and 253.97% for female with a cumulative exposure to Fusarium mycotoxins through consuming whole wheat flour, and deoxynivalenol was the main mycotoxin detected. In conclusion, whole wheat flour should be regarded with more health concern because of cumulative effects of co-occurred mycotoxins.},
