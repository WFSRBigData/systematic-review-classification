   abstract = {In warm agricultural areas across the globe, maize, groundnut, and other crops become frequently contaminated with aflatoxins produced primarily by the fungus Aspergillus flavus. Crop contamination with those highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds impacts both human and animal health, as well as the income of farmers and trade. In Nigeria, poultry productivity is hindered by high prevalence of aflatoxins in feeds. A practical solution to decrease crop aflatoxin content is to use aflatoxin biocontrol products based on non-toxin-producing strains of A. flavus. The biocontrol product Aflasafe® was registered in 2014 for use in maize and groundnut grown in Nigeria. Its use allows the production of aflatoxin-safe maize and groundnut. A portion of the maize treated with Aflasafe in Nigeria is being used to manufacture feeds used by the poultry industry, and productivity is improving. One of the conditions to register Aflasafe with the national regulator was to demonstrate both the safety of Aflasafe-treated maize to avian species and the impact of Aflasafe as a public good. Results presented here demonstrate that the use of maize colonized by an atoxigenic strain of Aflasafe resulted in superior (p &lt; 0.05) broiler performance in all evaluated parameters in comparison to broilers fed with toxigenic maize. Use of an aflatoxin-sequestering agent (ASA) was not sufficient to counteract the harmful effects of aflatoxins. Both the safety and public good value of Aflasafe were demonstrated during our study. In Nigeria, the availability of aflatoxin-safe crops as a result of using Aflasafe allows poultry producers to improve their productivity, their income, and the health of consumers of poultry products. © 2019 by the authors.},

DNA genome of the three A. flavus isolates (namely A. flavus _ YC; A. flavus _ RC; A. flavus _ Rice) which corresponds to isolates from, yellow corn, red corn and white rice respectively were used as a template for PCR to amplify Aspergillus flavus AFLR (aflR) toxin gene. Partially sequenced was amplified using a specific primer set to confirm its identity, phylogenetic relationships between the three isolates as well as determination of the corresponding antigenic determinants. The epitope prediction analysis demonstrated that there were 1, 2, 3 and 4 epitopes whose score were equal 1 in A. flavus _ YC; A. flavus _ RC; A. flavus _ Rice, respectively. Interestingly, there were great dissimilarity in the epitope sequences among the three isolates except in RLQEGGDDAAGIPA, SPPPPVETQGLGGD, RPSESLPSARSEQG and PAHNTYSTPHAHTQ were found to be similar between all isolates.

   abstract = {Arsenic is a ubiquitous metalloid in the biosphere, and its origin can be either geogenic or anthropic. Four oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and + 5) characterize organic and inorganic As- compounds. Although arsenic is reportedly a toxicant, its harmful effects are closely related to its chemical form: inorganic compounds are most toxic, followed by organic ones and finally by arsine gas. Although drinking water is the primary source of arsenic exposure to humans, the metalloid enters the food chain through its uptake by crops, the extent of which is tightly dependent on its phytoavailability. Arsenate is taken up by roots via phosphate carriers, while arsenite is taken up by a subclass of aquaporins (NIP), some of which involved in silicon (Si) transport. NIP and Si transporters are also involved in the uptake of methylated forms of As. Once taken up, its distribution is regulated by the same type of transporters albeit with mobility efficiencies depending on As forms and its accumulation generally occurs in the following decreasing order: roots > stems > leaves > fruits (seeds). Besides providing a survey on the uptake and transport mechanisms in higher plants, this review reports on measures able to reducing plant uptake and the ensuing transfer into edible parts. On the one hand, these measures include a variety of plant-based approaches including breeding, genetic engineering of transport systems, graft/rootstock combinations, and mycorrhization. On the other hand, they include agronomic practices with a particular focus on the use of inorganic and organic amendments, treatment of irrigation water, and fertilization. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Heavy metal (HMs) pollution is regarded as one of the major concerns for soil and water, causing varieties of toxic and stress effects on plants and ecosystems. It has become one of the important limiting factors to crop productivity and quality. Due to an ever-increasing population growth and food demands, this situation has further worsened. Rice, a leading staple food crop that feeds more than 50% populations of the world, is constantly affected by abiotic stressors including HMs. In most of the countries, a major source of HM intake by humans is the rice grain produced through the paddy soils contaminated with HMs such as As, Al, Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Hg, Mn, Se, and Zn. Thus, gradual agglomeration of HMs in rice grains and their subsequent transfer to the food chain is a major menace to agriculture and human health. In recent years, several studies examined the impact of HMs toxicity on rice at multiple levels: molecular, biochemical, physiological, cellular and tissue, and demonstrated a correlation between HMs toxicity and the decreasing trend in rice productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the interaction of HMs with rice crop spanning from the cell to whole plant level and devise appropriate effective means to alleviate these stress responses. This review focuses on tracing the pathways involved in stress responses and stress tolerance mechanisms displayed by different varieties of rice. However, it is essential to uncover the mechanisms related to stress responses in rice for designing improved investigations to develop novel varieties with high attributes. Therefore, this communication summarizes various defense strategies induced against HM stress and includes the function of metabolites (metabolomics), trace elements (ionomics), transcription factors (transcriptomics), and various stress-inducible proteins (proteomics) including the role of plant hormones. © 2019, Korean Society of Plant Biologists.},

Even if Haiti is the second maize consumer in the Caribbean region, its national yield is low and alleged of aflatoxin contamination. In order to increase grain yield, three introduced and two local maize varieties (these used as comparative control) were evaluated. Three field trials were carried out at Torbeck and Morne Briller (Port-Salut) during different growing seasons. Experiments were designed in a three-replicate randomized block. Each experimental plot was 3.50 m per 10.5 m with a gross area of 36.75 m2 and 40 000 plants/ha densities. The trials were carried out according to local agricultural practices. The results revealed that the introduced varieties had a smaller yield than the local ones. Moreover, all varieties showed some aflatoxin content below the European Union limit (5µg/Kg). Statistical analyses showed a strong and direct correlation between yield and ear weight and an inverse correlation between yield and male and female flowering day after sowing. The broad phenotypic diversity suggested a rich reserve of alleles to exploit in a breeding program focused to improve food security in Haiti. © 2019, Consiglio per la Ricercame la sperimentazione in Agrcoltura.

This work first evaluated the effect of package perforations on the infestation of cereal-fruit bars by the eggs of the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella). We measured the differential oviposition of moths on the unpackaged bars, empty packages, bars in packages and bars in perforated packages in choice and no-choice experiments. Almost 100% of the laid eggs were laid directly on the bars when they were placed in the enclosure without packaging. A low proportion of the eggs (0.4–3%) were laid on either the empty or non-perforated polypropylene foil packages. Plodia interpunctella efficiently located and infested the bars with eggs when 5 mm package perforations were present in no-choice test. In choice test P. interpunctella preferred to oviposit on open bars than on the packaged or perforated bars. After deposition on the bars the egg hatchability ranged between 40 and 74%. For the food industry, the most significant practical conclusions of this study are that non-perforated packages provide protection against oviposition of P. interpunctella, but small perforations enable the moth to infest the resource with eggs. © 2019, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

Taking Turkey as an example of a country with tight restrictions on the import and use of GM crops but limited resources for product monitoring, we developed a cost-effective 3-tier screening protocol, and tested 110 retail food products and 13 animal feeds available in 2016–2017 for GM ingredients. No evidence was found for the presence of GM wheat or rice in the foodstuffs tested; however, 6 feeds and 3 food products containing soybean and/or maize were positive for one or more GM elements. GM events present in positive samples were identified by event-specific PCR and quantified by real-time PCR. We also compared the results with previous surveys in Turkey. Overall, we observed consistent use of GM animal feeds; however, these were not labelled as GM at the point of sale. Occasional food products also tested positive for GM ingredients, usually at low concentrations that could be attributed to accidental contamination. © 2019, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

The application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a technique was evaluated on filtered urine residues of 12 randomly selected rice farmers from some parts of Kaduna State, Nigeria. The urine samples were screened for ova of Schistosoma haematobium by microscopy after filtration using polycarbonate membrane filters (Sterlitech, Kent, WA, USA) of pore size 12μm and 13 mm in diameter. Microscopy revealed a prevalence of 33.3% (4/12). All samples were further subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of the schistosome Dra1 repeat. PCR recorded an overall infectivity rate of 66.7% (8/12) among the rice farmers. Four out of the ova negative samples were confirmed to have the Dra1 repeat hence, making them positive for Schistosoma haematobium. Based on these findings, it can therefore be concluded that PCR can be especially useful in diagnosis of infections in nanograms. This will help in assessing the transmission potential of rice farmers living in low endemic areas and improve the effectiveness of surveillance of mass drug administration (MDA) control programmes as recommended by the World Health Organization. © Parasitology and Public Health Society of Nigeria, 2019.},

Quail were euthanized between 1 and 24 h postexposure to assess toxicokinetics. Analysis revealed rapid absorption (1 h) into blood and distribution to the brain, muscle, kidney, and liver. Clearance to below detection limits occurred at both dose levels and exposure durations in all tissues within 24 h. Metabolism was extensive, with 5-OH-IMI and IMI-olefin detected at greater concentrations than IMI in tissues and fecal samples. There was no lethality or overt signs of toxicity at either dose level. Furthermore, no evidence of enhanced expression of mRNA genes associated with hepatic xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative DNA damage, or alterations in concentrations of corticosterone and thyroid hormones was observed. Application of the toxicokinetic data was used to predict IMI residue levels in the liver with reasonable results for some field exposure and avian mortality events. It would appear that some affected species of birds are either consuming larger quantities of seeds or exhibit differences in ADME or sensitivity than predicted by read-across from these data.},

   abstract = {Sorghum is a cereal containing many bioactive compounds; however, its use for the human diet requires the development of products that attend the consumer's needs and preferences. Six sorghum genotypes of different colors were analyzed to develop a new beverage. The whole grains were analyzed for their chemical composition, condensed tannins (CT), total phenolic compounds (TPC), antioxidant capacity (AC) and resistant starch (RS). After grinding they were and processed by thermoplastic extrusion to develop a soluble beverage and their wettability, dispersibility, bulk and absolute density were evaluated. Sorghum is poorly used directly in the human diet; therefore, consumer perception of sorghum was investigated, as well as the sensory characterization of the beverages. Brown sorghum presented the highest CT, TPC, AC and RS. Powder from red sorghum presented the highest wettability and sensory acceptance, whereas, powder from white sorghum had the lowest absolute density, wettability, dispersibility and sensory acceptance. Additionally, sensory acceptance presented positive Pearson's correlation with good rehydration characteristics, and the residual bitter taste was directly correlated with AC. Finally, people with food restrictions (i.e. intolerances, allergies, veganism among others) considered sorghum as an alternative food, although they do not know this cereal. The unfamiliarity, the chemical properties and solubility properties all affected the sensory acceptance.},

   abstract = {Among grains, rice is one of the most widely consumed cereals in the world; it represents a staple food in great part of Asia and Africa, and it is also broadly diffused in America and Europe. One of the main issues of storing rice is to protect it from animal attacks; in particular, it is prone to insect infestation. Despite all the attempts made to avoid it (developing new physical barriers, traps and repellants), often food pests manage to break into granary and parcels, contaminating stored commodities. As a consequence, possible infestations must be continuously checked by producers and/or retailers. Different methods have been developed to detect insects in stored commodities, and, despite some of them demonstrated to perform well, they present the substantial limitation of being destructive. This latter characteristic undoubtedly leads to an obvious loss of product (and consequently, of profit), affecting farmers, retailers, and, finally, consumers. For this reason, the aim of the present work is to develop a methodology for the identification of insect infestation in stored rice by NIR spectroscopy coupled with discriminant and modeling classification methods. In particular, among all the different pests possibly present in granaries, the focus has been on detection of the Indian-meal moth (Plodia interpunctella), because it is considered one of the most common infesting insects. Different samples of rice, both infested and edible, coming from different farmers located in six different Countries (Cambodia, India, Italy, Pakistan, Suriname and Thailand) have been analyzed by NIR spectroscopy. Consequently, two different classification methods, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) have been applied in order to distinguish among infested and edible samples. In particular, PLS-DA allows correctly classifying 95.6% of the edible 97.5% of the contaminated samples (on the external validation set), whereas the SIMCA model, built only for the category of non-contaminated individuals, resulted highly specific (about 97%) but poorly sensitive on the test specimens. This latter approach (SIMCA) provided better predictions (in particular, in terms of sensitivity) when separate individual models were built subdividing samples in agreement with their country of origin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The application of synthetic fungicides in the field may trigger mycotoxin accumulation, since fungistatic levels of those compounds might cause fungal responses to stress. Hence, new alternatives are needed for its control. The aim of this work was to compare the effects of a natural antifungal compound, the antifungal protein PgAFP, and a synthetic commercial one, on Alternaria tenuissima sp.-grp. growth, mycotoxin biosynthesis (tenuazonic acid and alternariols) and the expression of a stress-related gene associated with cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, in a wheat-based medium at two water activities (a(w); 0.95 and 0.98 a(w)) conditions associated with the ripening of this grain. The application of both antifungals produced comparable fungistatic effects on Alternaria spp. growth. However, the presence of PgAFP produced a significant reduction in mycotoxins accumulation, whereas this effect was not observed with the commercial antifungal. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the influence of fungicides on the expression of a key gene involved in CWI stress-related pathway in relation to Alternaria mycotoxins accumulation. This information is useful when developing new antifungal methods for foods. The application of PgAFP would be a promising natural strategy for its application in wheat for the control of Alternaria spp.},

Ochratoxin A, a toxic fungal secondary metabolite, is well known as a nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, embryotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic agent, classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as "possibly carcinogenic to humans". Objective. The aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of ochratoxin A in breakfast cereals and sweet snacks in order to estimate the dietary exposure of the Italian population, considering the widespread use of these products for all ages, and in particular for children and teenagers. Method. Ochratoxin A was detected by ELISA technique. The calculation of the estimated exposure was performed by a deterministic approach. Results and discussion. The percentages of contaminated samples tested were 8% for breakfast cereals and 51% for sweet snacks with a range of contamination from 0.5 to 2.1 ng/g. The mean estimated daily intake, depending on age categories, ranged from 2.9% to 8.6% of the latest provisional tolerable daily intake recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (17 ng/kg bw/d) calculated on the total diet. Children and teenagers result to be higher in exposure per kg body weight compared to adults. Conclusions. The estimate of ochratoxin A exposure levels calculated in the study does not represent a great concern for public health because they are not associated with a significant cancer risk. © 2019, Societa Editrice Universo.},

The replacement of corn by cassava dregs did not influence omega-6:omega-3 ration or the total desirable fatty acids, as well as the color, aroma, tenderness, juiciness, or overall evaluation scores. Cassava dregs may be added in the diets of lambs, without negative effects on physicochemical characteristics, chemical composition, and fatty acid indexes, with positive effects on unsaturated fatty acid content.

Despite fewer land resources and higher reliance on imported energy and raw material resources, the potential for bioenergy supply in a place like Taiwan should be fully investigated. This paper presents a case study regarding the utilization of waste biomass derived from an enhanced production of rice paddy and from the forest sector in Taiwan for biofuel production. In this study, the carbon balance for the two aforementioned bioenergy production scenarios was calculated. The amount of biomass waste expected to be derived from rice husk and rice straw produced from currently planted paddy and from reactivated fallow rice paddy was estimated. Forest sector wastes consist of biomass derived from processing domestically harvested and post-consumer harvested wood products. The projection was made up to 2065. The overall annual bioenergy providing potential of the biomass, estimated by this study, to replace gasoline through bioethanol production and residual combustion and to substitute coal for power generation via combustion were approximately 222.37 PJ and 206.77 PJ, respectively. These values represent 332.56% and 323.24% of the current level of bioenergy supplies, compared to the 76.4 PJ from biomass and waste incineration in 2016. This is the first time the bioenergy potential of post-consumer harvested wood products is being identified. © 2018},

   abstract = {Aflatoxin contamination in corn poses threats to consumer food safety and grower economic stability. Current industrial methods for aflatoxin management in corn focus on the bulk aflatoxin level, which can lead to either acceptance of lots with contaminated corn kernels (consumer food safety risk) or rejection of lots with mostly harmless corn kernels (grower economic loss). This dilemma may be resolved by utilizing spectroscopy to classify single corn kernels. Hence, our research aims to investigate the potential of using a custom-built UltraViolet-Visible-Near InfraRed spectroscopy system (UV-Vis-NIR) to classify single corn kernels by aflatoxin level. Single kernels from cobs inoculated with aflatoxin-producing Asperaus flavus (240 kernels) and uninoculated cobs (240 kernels) were i) scanned individually for reflectance from 304 nm to 1086 nm by an increment of 0.5 nm; ii) ground; iii) measured for aflatoxin by ELISA. Using the spectra and the aflatoxin concentration, a random forest model was trained on 80% of the kernels to classify single corn kernels above or below 20 ppb of aflatoxin and was tested on the remaining 20% of the kernels. Among 480 kernels, 374 kernels had <20 ppb of aflatoxin and 106 kernels had >= 20 ppb of aflatoxin. The random forest model had a sensitivity of 87.1% and specificity of 97.7% in the training set and a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 97.3% in the test set, which is higher than previous models where kernels were in motion and comparable to models where kernels were stationary. Spectral regions around 390, 540, and 1050 nm are found to be important for classification. This study demonstrated the custom-built UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy system showed considerable potential in classifying single corn kernels by aflatoxin level while the kernels are in motion.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species on cereals represent a major concern for food safety worldwide. Fusarium toxins that are currently under regulation for their content in food include trichothecenes, fumonisins, and zearalenone. Biological control of Fusarium spp. has been widely explored with the aim of limiting disease occurrence, but few efforts have focused so far on limiting toxin accumulation in grains. The bacterial genus Streptomyces is responsible for the production of numerous drug molecules and represents a huge resource for the discovery of new molecules. Streptomyces spp. are also efficient plant colonizers and able to employ different mechanisms of control against toxigenic fungi on cereals. This review describes the outcomes of research using Streptomyces strains and/or their derived molecules to limit toxin production and/or contamination of Fusarium species in cereals. Both the scientific and patent literature were analyzed, starting from the year 2000, and we highlight promising results as well as the current pitfalls and limitations of this approach.},

   abstract = {Background: Breast milk is considered an essential food segment for children up to 6 months; however, it can be contaminated with some mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) and ochratoxin A (OTA) as a consequence of ingestion of dietary mycotoxins by lactating mothers. Moreover, the health of infants can be threatened due to simultaneous exposure to a mixture of mycotoxins mainly due to their potential synergistic effects. Scope and approach: An overview of the prevalence of mycotoxins in breast milk and infant formula, fruit- and cereal-based products as routine diets of infants during the last 10 years, besides the associated health risks, were presented. In this regard, the relevant citations published in international databases such as PubMed, Science direct from 2008 to 2019 were screened by the aid of a systematic review approach. Key findings and conclusions: The high prevalence of AFM(1) and OTA in breast milk reported in several countries highlighted the extent of mycotoxin occurrence in the diet of lactating mothers. Furthermore, the exposure rates of infants to mycotoxins in breast milk and infant formula while generated a margin of exposure values lower than 10,000, indicating a huge public health concern. Thus, reducing the dietary exposure of mycotoxins for lactating mothers and approaching the required controlling steps during the processing and distribution of infant formulas are crucial. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the health risks to infants due to dietary exposure to multiple mycotoxins in infant foods.},

Concomitantly, the search for safer natural products has gained importance since consumers began to look for less processed and chemically treated foods. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal and antimycotoxigenic effect of seven strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were grown on Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth at 37 ºC in anaerobic conditions. After that, the cell-free supernatant (CFS) were recovered to determine its antifungal activity by halo diffusion agar test. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined for each L. plantarum CFS by 96-well microplates method. Additionally, CFS was used as a natural biocontrol agent on corn kernels and corn ears contaminated with Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides, respectively. The L. plantarum CECT 749 CFS showed the highest antifungal effect against all essayed strains. Moreover, the employment of this CFS in food reduced the mycotoxin production at a percentage ranging from 73.7 to 99.7%. These results suggest that the L. plantarum CECT 749 CFS could be promising for the biocontrol of corn. © 2019 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Cereals are a staple food for many people around the world; however, they are also a major dietary source of toxic metal(loid)s. Many agricultural regions throughout the world are contaminated with toxic metal(loid)s, which can accumulate to high levels in the grains of cereals cultivated in these regions, posing serious health risks to consumers. Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) are efficiently accumulated in cereals through metal transport pathways. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop crops that contain greatly reduced levels of toxic metal(loid)s. Vacuolar sequestration of toxic metal(loid)s is a primary strategy for reducing toxic metal(loid)s in grains. However, until recently, detailed strategies and mechanisms for reducing toxic metal(loid)s in grain were limited by the lack of experimental data. New strategies to reduce As and Cd in grain by enhancing vacuolar sequestration in specific tissues are critical to develop crops that lower the daily intake of As and Cd, potentially improving human health. This review provides insights and strategies for developing crops with strongly reduced amounts of toxic metal(loid)s without jeopardizing agronomic traits.

Food storage systems are designed to provide constraints to spoilage organisms by presenting mechanical barrier or unfavourable atmospheric conditions to their growth and productivity. This study examined the physical factors generated in hermetic SuperGrainBags® during the storage of ‘Obatanpa’ variety of maize (Zea mays L.) and the effect on growth of the larger grain borer Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) and aflatoxin contamination by Aspergillus flavus. Cultured P. truncatus or A. flavus was introduced into 1.5 kg of the dried maize and stored in either hermetic SuperGrainBags® or non-hermetic polypropylene bags. The hermetic conditions elicited an increase in the interstitial temperature (ca. 27 °C) but a decrease in the relative humidity (&lt;70%), oxygen concentration (&lt;6.4%) and the grain moisture content (&lt;13.7%), the combined effects of which inhibited growth of the insects and aflatoxin production by the moulds. Total mortality of P. truncatus occurred after 52 d of storage in the SuperGrainBags® while aflatoxins concentration remained within safe limits for human consumption. In contrast, there was proliferous growth of P. truncatus and significant increase in aflatoxin concentration to lethargic levels within the polypropylene bags where temperature, relative humidity and grain moisture increased significantly. Accordingly, grain damage and weight loss percentages were significantly high in the polypropylene bags while that in the SuperGrainBags® were negligible. Altogether, the SuperGrainBags® better preserved the maize grain quality and safeguarded it against health risks than the polypropylene bags. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Chromium (Cr) contamination in rice imposes a serious concern to human health as rice is used as staple food throughout the world. Although several studies have established the differential response of miRNAs in rice during heavy metal (arsenic, cadmium) and heat or cold stress, no report is available about the response of miRNAs during Cr stress. In the present study, we identified 512 and 568 known miRNAs from Cr treated and untreated samples, respectively. Expression analysis revealed that 13 conserved miRNAs (miR156, miR159, miR160, miR166, miR169, miR171, miR396, miR397, miR408, miR444, miR1883, miR2877, miR5072) depicted preferential up- or down-regulation (> 4-fold change; P value < 0.05). Target gene prediction of differentially expressed miRNAs and their functional annotation suggested the important role of miRNAs in defence and detoxification of Cr though ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), transcription factors, heat shock proteins, auxin response, and metal ion transport. Real-time PCR analysis validated the differential expression of selected miRNAs and their putative target genes. In conclusion, our study identifies and predicts miRNA-mediated regulation of signalling pathway in rice during Cr stress. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {This review examines estimations made over the last two decades of the wheat yield losses in India due to elevated tropospheric ozone (O3) and to aerosol pollution. Notwithstanding the poor record of O3 and solar radiation measurement in wheat regions, a reasonable estimate can be made yield losses around 2010. From an average of the more credible studies, this is around 30% compared to the yield which would have been achieved with 1970 solar radiation and O3 assumed to be &lt;40 ppb (parts per billion by volume). The results suggest that O3 causes two-thirds of the loss and reduced total solar radiation due to aerosols (but corrected for increased diffuse radiation) one-third. Ozone, in particular, appears to be still increasing. It is likely that increased stomatal conductance (e.g. due to more irrigation (97% of production now irrigated) and the unwitting consequence of breeding for increased potential yield) has added to current O3 losses. Much is known about the physiology of O3 damage in the wheat leaf and plant. What is lacking is a thorough search for genetic tolerance independent of stomatal conductance and potential yield penalties, and this requires, at least initially, many chamber and/or FACE (free-air CO2 enhancement) experiments under typical Indian field conditions. Genetic engineering could offer a solution for O3 but only in the long term. Other solutions to pollution damage are very limited, but earlier planting should help wheat escape the rising O3 level in the spring. The 40 million tonnes of wheat currently foregone annually by India due to these two pollutants, even if an overestimate, far exceeds estimates of wheat yield loss to date due to climate change and demands concerted action to reduce the sources of this pollution, bringing added direct advantages for other crops and for human health. © The Author(s) 2019.},

The model was based on a typical Dutch maize chain, with maize grown in the Black Sea region, and transported by ship to the Netherlands for use as an ingredient in compound feed for dairy cattle. Six different scenarios, with different aflatoxin concentrations at harvest and possible aflatoxin production during transport, were used. By minimizing the costs and using parameters such as the concentration, the variance of the sampling plan, and the monitoring and replacement costs, the model optimized the control points (CPs; e.g., after harvest, before or after transport by sea ship), the number of batches sampled at the CP, and the number of samples per batch. This optimization approach led to an end-of-chain aflatoxin concentration below the predetermined limit. The model showed that, when postharvest aflatoxin production was not possible, it was most cost-effective to collect samples from all batches and replace contaminated batches directly after the harvest, since the replacement costs were the lowest at the origin of the chain. When there was aflatoxin production during storage, it was most cost-effective to collect samples and replace contaminated batches after storage and transport to avoid the duplicate before and after monitoring and replacement costs. Further along the chain a contaminated batch is detected, the more stakeholders are involved, the more expensive the replacement costs and possible recall costs become. © 2019 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.},

EOs are highly volatile compounds and we have developed a new niosome-based encapsulation method to extend their shelf life and activity.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Rice adulteration in the food industry that infringes on the interests of consumers is considered very serious. To realize the rapid and precise quantitation of adulterated rice, a visible near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imaging system (380-1000 nm) was developed in the present study. A Savitsky-Golay first derivative (SG1) transform was utilized to eliminate the constant spectral baseline offset. Then, the adulterated levels of rice samples were quantified by partial least squares regression (PLSR). RESULTS A SG1-PLSR model based on full-wavelength was attained with a coefficient of determination of prediction set (R-P) of 0.9909, root-mean-square error of prediction set (RMSEP) of 0.0447 g kg(-1) and residual predictive deviation (RPDP) of 11.28. Furthermore, fifteen important wavelengths were selected based on the weighted regression coefficients (B-W) and a simplified model (PLSR-15) was established with R-P of 0.9769, RMSEP of 0.0708 g kg(-1) and RPDP of 3.49. Finally, two visualization maps produced by applying the optimal models (SG1-PLSR and PLSR-15) were used to visualize the adulterated levels of rice. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that VNIR hyperspectral imaging system is an effective tool for rapidly quantifying and visualizing the adulterated levels of rice.

Biofortified millet contained up to two times more iron than the local variety, reaching 6.5 mg iron/100 g dry matter. Iron and zinc contents remained higher in biofortified varieties even after decortication. Iron content in the dishes was highly variable, depending on iron loss and potential contamination during processing. The phytate-to-mineral molar ratios of all dishes indicated low iron absorption, independent of the millet variety, but improved zinc absorption in dishes prepared with biofortified varieties. The contribution of a dish prepared with one of the two biofortified millet varieties to the recommended iron and zinc intakes for 6–11-month-old children was estimated to be about 5 and 7%, respectively, compared to 2 and 4% for the same dish prepared with local millet. For 12–23-month-old children, the contribution to the recommended intakes was estimated to be about 14 and 12% with biofortified millet, respectively, and about 6 and 7% with local millet. The use of biofortified millet varieties could be complementary to food diversification strategies to increase iron and zinc intakes. As in Ouagadougou, cereals are eaten in different forms by young children several times per day, iron and zinc intakes could be improved in the long term by using the biofortified varieties of pearl millet. © Copyright © 2019 Hama-Ba, Mouquet-Rivier, Diawara, Weltzien and Icard-Vernière.},

   abstract = {Background and objectives Nixtamalized dry masa flour was supplemented with 5% or 10% dry soybean bagasse (SB) and then processed into table tortillas. Proximate chemical composition, dietary fiber content, affective sensory analyses of corn tortillas prepared from dry masa flour enriched with 5% or 10% dried SB were determined. Also, the in vitro protein digestibility and protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of the tortillas were evaluated. Findings Ten per cent SB addition reduced masa hardness by about 32% and chewiness 47% without affecting adhesiveness. In terms of rapid viscosity analysis, the addition of incremental levels of SB decreased peak and final viscosities 42% and 49%, respectively. The tortilla insoluble and soluble dietary fiber contents increased 50% and fourfold, respectively, while the lysine daily requirement for preschool infants improved from 45.6% to 67.0% when 10% SB was used. Enriched tortillas showed a similar overall acceptance and had improved texture over storage time at room temperature (25% less force to rupture compared with the control tortilla stored for the same time). Conclusions The addition of 5% soybean bagasse to nixtamalized corn flour produced masa with good machinability and tortillas with better overall acceptance and textural shelf life and a product with four times more soluble dietary fiber, 10% less starch and with higher amounts of limiting amino acids lysine and tryptophan. The upgraded amino acid balance significantly improved PDCAAS from 41% to 59% in the tortilla containing 10% SB. Significance and novelty: Soybean bagasse is a viable option to increased fiber and protein quality in nixtamalized corn flour tortillas, with a positive impact on texture during shelf life and consumer acceptance.},

   abstract = {Background: Reducing cadmium (Cd) exposure in Cd-polluted areas in Asia is urgently needed given the toxic effects of Cd. The short-term and long-term benefits of lowering Cd exposure are unknown because of its long half-life in the body. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether an intervention with low-Cd rice in a contaminated area of China reduced urinary Cd (UCd) levels and improved blood pressure and kidney function outcomes compared to no-intervention in consumers of high-Cd rice in the same region. Methods: 106 non-smoking subjects were divided into three treatment groups: the intervention group (replacing homegrown high-Cd rice with market low-Cd rice, n = 34), the non-intervention group (continue eating high-Cd rice, n = 36) and the control group (continued eating low-Cd rice they have been eating for years, n = 36). The intervention period lasted for almost 8 months, during which participants were visited on up to 4 occasions and UCd, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), kidney function biomarkers (beta(2)-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase) were measured. Results: After 3 months, the geometric mean UCd in the intervention (Int) group decreased significantly by 0.32 mu g/g (p = 0.007), while changes were not significant in the non-intervention (non-Int) group (0.13 mu g/g, p = 0.95) or the control group (-0.01 mu g/g, p = 0.52). UCd in the Int group remained lower than in the non-Int group but higher than in the Control group through the end of follow up. DBP in the Int group decreased significantly from 80 mm Hg at month three (p = 0.03) and stayed around 74 mm Hg for the remainder of the study. SBP also decreased in the Int group but with variations similar to those observed in the other two groups. The two kidney biomarkers showed variations without a clear pattern. Conclusion: This study suggested that UCd reflected both short-term (<3 months) and long-term Cd exposure. In addition, the low-Cd rice intervention showed initial benefits in lowering blood pressure levels, especially DBP, but not kidney biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Background: Cereals are globally consumed as staple food, providing essential nutrients to the consumers. The emerging problems associated with cereals are mycotoxin outbreaks and adulteration in both the cereals and their products. Both classical and emerging techniques are extensively exploited to tackle such problems. However classical methods still face more limitations as compared to emerging nondestructive methods. Scope and methods: High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, are classical methods employed for assessing the quality and safety parameters of cereal foods, with limitations of offline, time consuming and destructiveness. On the other hand, emerging nondestructive methodologies like hyperspectral imaging, fluorescence spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have been introduced as promising techniques for the assessment of fungal contamination, quality discrimination and adulteration detection in cereals and cereal products. This review highlights the most recent applications of enlisted classical and emerging approaches, their working principles and advances in determining various safety and quality attributes of cereals and their products. Besides, challenges and future trends, their advantages and limitations are also elucidated. Key findings and conclusions: Classical methods have been exploited for safety and quality measurement of cereal foods with relatively low efficiency, as compared to emerging nondestructive techniques. Classical methods suffer from disadvantages of destructiveness, thus they cannot be used for on-line monitoring, detection and evaluation. Emerging approaches are reliable with accurate, fast and non-invasive nature of investigations for the authentication of safety and quality attributes of cereal grains and their products during storage and processing. These innovative technologies can overcome the complexity, troubles, destructibility and slowness associated with classical analytical tools. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to know about the effect of simple parboiling on physical properties, proximate composition, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity. These were studied in raw and parboiled paddy varieties as well as bioaccessibility of specific nutrients (minerals, starch, and antioxidants). The pigmented rice paddy varieties such as Jyothi, Meter & Athikaraya were parboiled by hot soaking treatment after soaking for 2, 2½, and 3 hr. Athikaraya rice showed high protein, low ash in raw and parboiled than other varieties. Amylose equivalents of all three varieties exhibited in the range of 24%–27% (d.b). Whereas, the soluble amylose content showed 12.7, 8.7, and 7.7% (d.b) in Athikaraya, Meter and Jyothi rice varieties, respectively. Jyothi rice showed less cooking time and more cooking volume. Athikaraya showed high phenolic content and antioxidant properties compared to other two varieties. The dialysability of minerals, starch, and antioxidants were increased due to simple hot soaking parboiling. Practical applications: The present study has the significance in assessing the variation among different pigmented rice varieties after parboiling by simple hot soaking with various soaking periods. The industrial advantage of this method is, there is no usage of boiler for cooking the paddy by steam, which was economically better. The information gained by this study might be beneficial for consumers and suppliers regarding the quality of the selected pigmented rice varieties with respect to nutrient composition, antioxidant activities, and bioaccessibility of minerals, starch, and antioxidants. Ultimately, the present study can lead to better appreciation of pigmented rice and assist food processors in selecting rice variety with unique characteristics for specialty food preparations. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Dietary aflatoxin exposure is a widespread problem in the developing world and causes severe negative health consequences to humans and livestock animals. A new biological control product, called Aflasafe, has been introduced in Nigeria to mitigate aflatoxin contamination of maize in the field and in storage. No known prior work has estimated how much African agribusinesses using maize for animal feed will pay for aflatoxin-safe maize. This study measured the levels of Aflasafe awareness, surveyed current aflatoxin management practices, and estimated, using choice experiments, willingness to pay (WTP) for aflatoxin-safe maize by Nigerian poultry producers and feed millers. Data was gathered from 272 orally administered surveys, which included discrete choice experiments examining maize purchasing decisions. Results suggest that the proportion of enterprises that were aware of aflatoxin was found to vary across states. Two latent classes of Nigerian poultry producers and feed millers were identified that were willing to pay average premiums of 4.9% and 30.9%, respectively for maize with 10 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxin concentration relative to maize with 20 ppb aflatoxin concentration. Both latent classes were, on average, willing to pay larger premiums for maize with 4 ppb aflatoxin concentration. There was evidence that latent class membership, and hence WTP, varied based on awareness of aflatoxin and across geographies.},

   abstract = {On account of complexities associated with commercial production of second-generation biofuels, comprehensive examinations are required to enhance the economic feasibility of biobutanol production from cellulosic compounds. As the most abundant crop residue in the US, corn stover is a readily available feedstock for biorefineries. However, there are few studies to evaluate the corn stover application in the large-scale biobutanol production. In this regard, in order to estimate the amount of collectible corn stover special to biobutanol production, a quantitate model was presented. In this model, the residue potential quantity, job creation, butanol blends potential quantity, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and social costs, forecasting future trends, economic evaluation, and risk analysis are considered. It was estimated that a total quantity of 84 million tonnes (Mt) of stover for the production of about 10.48 gigaliters (Gl) of biobutanol can potentially be collected. Around 87.4% of the total collectible residues is produced in the Midwest. A total of 81,000 jobs can be generated and Iowa can potentially create the most jobs. Furthermore, around 9.5 Gl of gasoline can be saved and about 64.6 Gl of butanol-gasoline blend (Bu16) can potentially be produced from corn residues in the US, which is equivalent to 11.8% of total domestic gasoline consumption. The average minimum selling price (MSP) in the Midwest was $5.76 and $4.05 per gallon depending on the feedstock price, and Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota were predicted to be very attractive in terms of lower selling prices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Consumption of OTA-contaminated baby foods exerts health implications especially in children as the most vulnerable subpopulations. In the current study, for the first time in Iran, 64 baby foods (rice, wheat, and multigrain) samples from five different brands available in the Iranian market were analyzed to determine OTA level, using a HPLC with fluorescence detector. Overall, OTA was observed in 41% of analyzed samples with a mean and maximum level of 0.42 ± 0.27 and 1.1 μg/kg, respectively. OTA levels in five of 64 samples (7.8 %) were higher than the permissible limit recommended by European Commission (permissible limit: 0.5 μg/kg) and OTA levels in two of 64 samples (3.1%) were higher than the standard set by Iranian standard organization (1 μg/kg). The highest OTA contamination was observed in rice-based baby food cereals (1.1 μg/kg; 57% of the samples), followed by wheat-based (23%) and multigrain (20%) samples. OTA intake in infants (≥9 months old) was more than established provisional tolerable weekly intake by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (100 and 120 ng OTA per kg of body weight, respectively).

The aim of this study was to review existing research about the quantity, type, and degree of infant cereal processing, with a special focus on whole grain infant cereals. Accumulating evidence shows many benefits of whole grain consumption for human health. Likewise, consumers are frequently linking the term whole grains to healthiness and naturality, and sustainable food production becomes a more important aspect when choosing an infant cereal brand. Whole grain cereals should be consumed as early as possible, i.e., during infancy. However, there are several challenges that food manufacturers are facing that need to be addressed. Recommendations are needed for the intake of whole grain cereals for infants and young children, including product-labeling guidelines for whole grain foods targeting these age stages. Another challenge is minimizing the higher contaminant content in whole grains, as well as those formed during processing. Yet, the greatest challenge may be to drive consumers’ acceptance, including taste. The complementary feeding period is absolutely key in shaping the infant’s food preferences and habits; therefore, it is the appropriate stage in life at which to introduce whole grain cereals for the acceptance of whole grains across the entire lifespan. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, we provide specific recommendations significant for experimental procedures of laboratory studies to test potential adverse effects of Bt maize on larvae of non-target Lepidoptera. We searched and analysed both ecotoxicological test protocols for pesticides in the EU as well as the non-target tests with Lepidoptera applied in unpublished industry studies submitted officially by agro-companies for the GMO authorisation in Europe. Results: The classical ecotoxicology protocols applied for testing pesticides could serve as general guidelines, but do not completely fit the specific and differing requirements for assessing non-target effects of transgenic crops. The analysis of the non-target studies submitted for the application of the cultivation of Bt maize in Europe revealed critical limitations, thus corroborating the urgent need for common quality criteria. Based on our evaluations, we identified several issues requiring harmonisation or standardisation of the experimental conditions and approach, e.g., the application of Bt maize pollen, synthetic toxins, the provided diet for larvae, experimental controls, magnitude and duration of exposure to Bt, relevant variables to be recorded, and sufficient statistical power. Conclusions: Our recommendations should stimulate the development of precise guidance for the authorities, and support the operationalisation of the required laboratory tests for the evaluation of non-target effects of Bt maize pollen on non-target Lepidoptera, also contributing to standards of other ecotoxicity tests with Lepidoptera larvae, e.g., for pesticides. © 2019, The Author(s).},

However, most Asian countries are facing food safety problems due to cropland contamination by heavy metals. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate genetic factors affecting the expression of cadmium (Cd) gene, and to confirm differences in Cd translocation among cultivars because the current molecular understanding of Cd uptake-transport mechanisms remains insufficient. Associations between genotypes and gene expression level of Cd-related genes such as NRAMP, MTP, and HMA gene families in the rice core collection were analyzed at the genomic level. Results: Os01g0956700, Os05g0128400 and Os11g0485200 showed strong associations between expression level and genotype in the rice core collection, the regulatory factors that associated with these genes in cis and trans were founded. The association between the expression level and genotype of the candidate gene (Os01g0611300: metal tolerance protein) predicted to affect Cd content in rice by a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) was also analyzed. Furthermore, as a result of the phylogeny and haplotype analyses of the candidate gene, high-Cd tolerance cultivars were selected. The correlations between Cd and other inorganic components (Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) in the roots, stems, leaves and unpolished grain of selected rice cultivars were analyzed. Conclusion: Therefore, these results may be useful for understanding the uptake-transport mechanisms of Cd and other inorganic components via molecular genetics and may help rice breeders develop new low-Cd cultivars in the near future. © 2019, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Activated biochar has been used in various areas, i.e., wastewater treatment. However, biochar contains volatile organic compounds, some of which are toxic organic pollutants that pose health risks to human. In this study, activated biochar was prepared by pyrolysis method using rice husks as raw materials and H2O as the activator. The volatile organic compound concentration of biochar before and after activation, as well as the adsorption characteristics of activated biochar, was investigated. The structure of the biochar was characterized by FTIR, SEM, and specific surface area analyzer. The results showed that activated biochar surface was mainly composed of carboxyl groups, and no phenolic hydroxyl or lactone groups formed during the process. In total, 54 volatile organic compounds were analyzed by a gas chromatography–mass spectrometer. The detection frequency of 45 volatile organic compounds reached 100%. The concentration of sum of these compounds was 93.26 and 110.62 μg/g in the biochar before and after activation, respectively. Results of adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption and resolution of activated biochar to n-hexane were 29.33 and 5.4 mg/g, respectively. Compared to the biochar sample without activation, the activated biochar with the ratio of charcoal to water of 3:1 showed the best adsorption to n-hexane, whose surface area reached 351.23 m2/g. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

   abstract = {Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an indole-tetramine mycotoxin commonly produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus and is widely found in agricultural products, fermented food, and feed. Food contaminated with CPA poses a substantial health risk to consumers. Therefore, eco-friendly immunoassays, including an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) and a lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (LFICS), were developed to monitor CPA in maize and rice samples. For this purpose, a monoclonal antibody (3H12) posed highly resistant to pH (5.6 to 9.6) and ethanol (<= 50%) was generated by mouse immunization. Negative maize and rice samples or samples spiked with CPA were extracted with ethanol/0.01 M sodium borate buffer (4/1, v/v, pH 8.4). For ic-ELISA analysis, the limits of detection (LODs) were 0.48 and 0.28 ng/g for maize and rice samples, respectively. The recovery for spiked maize was 76.9% to 83.5% with the highest variable coefficient (CVmax) being 9.32%. For spiked rice, the recovery was 85.3% to 105.1% with a CVmax of 8.56%. For LFICS analysis, the visible LODs were 2.5 and 1 ng/g and cutoff values were 5 and 2.5 ng/g for maize and rice samples, respectively. The LFICS method gave results within 5 to 10 min, providing an auxiliary analytical tool for the rapid, sensitive, and portable screening of the massive samples onsite.},

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is one of heavy metals harmful to human health. As rice is the main staple food in Asia and Cd is easily contaminated in rice, the molecular regulation of Cd accumulation should be explored. In this study, a recombinant inbred population derived from Xiang 743/Katy was grown in Cd-polluted fields and used to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Cd accumulation in rice grains. We identified seven QTLs distributed on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10. These QTLs displayed phenotypic variances of 58.50% and 40.59% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Two QTLs, qCd-2 and qCd-7, were identified in both the two years. qCd-2 was detected on the interval of RM250-RM207 on chromosome 2, with an LOD of 2.51 and a phenotypic contribution of 13.75% in 2014, and an LOD of 3.35 and a phenotypic contribution of 14.16% in 2015. qCd-7 co-localized with the cloned qCdT7 on chromosome 7 and may represent the correct candidate. The other five QTLs were detected only in one year. To further confirm the effects of qCd-2, a residual heterozygous line designated as RHL945, with a heterozygous interval of RM263-RM207 on chromosome 2, was selected from the recombinant inbred population and used to develop an F-2 population consisting of 155 individual plants. By incorporating further simple sequence repeat markers into the segmental linkage map of the target region, qCd-2 was delimited in the interval of RM5404-RM3774, with an LOD value of 4.38 and a phenotypic contribution of 15.52%. These results reflected the genetic regulation of grain Cd in rice and paved the way for the future cloning of qCd-2.},

   abstract = {Accumulation of toxic heavy metals and metalloids (THMMs) in crop grain remarkably affects food safety and human health. Reducing the content of THMMs in grain requires the identification and manipulation of the genes regulating their accumulation. This study aimed to determine the genetic variations affecting grain THMM accumulation in rice by using association mapping. We used 276 accessions with 416 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and performed genome-wide association analysis of grain THMM concentrations in rice grown in heavily multi-contaminated farmlands. We detected 22, 17, and 21 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain arsenic, cadmium, and lead concentrations, respectively. Both inter-and intra-subpopulation variants accounted for these QTLs. Most QTLs contained no known THMM-related genes and represented unidentified novel genes. We examined the candidate genes in qGAS1, a QTL for grain arsenic concentration with the best P-value detected for the entire population. We speculated that a transport protein of the multidrug and toxin extrusion family could be the candidate gene for this QTL. Our study suggested that the genetic regulation of grain THMM accumulation is very complex and largely unknown. The QTLs and SNPs identified in this study might help in the identification of new genes regulating THMM accumulation and aid in marker-assisted breeding of rice with low grain THMM content.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe variable domain of camelid heavy-chain antibodies (VHH) is increasingly being adapted to detect small molecules in various matrices. The insecticide carbaryl is widely used in agriculture while its residues have posed a threat to food safety and human health. RESULTSVHHs specific for carbaryl were generated from an alpaca immunized with the hapten CBR1 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the VHH C1 and the coating antigen CBR2-BSA was developed for the detection of carbaryl in cereals. This assay, using an optimized assay buffer (pH6.5) containing 10% methanol and 0.8% NaCl, has a half-maximum signal inhibition concentration of 5.4ngmL(-1) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3ngmL(-1) for carbaryl, and shows low cross reactivity (<= 0.8%) with other tested carbamates. The LOD of carbaryl using the VHH-based ELISA was 36ngg(-1) in rice and maize and 72ngg(-1) in wheat. Recoveries of carbaryl in spiked rice, maize and wheat samples were in the range of 81-106%, 96-106% and 83-113%, respectively. Relative standard deviations of repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility were in the range of 0.8-9.2% and 2.9-9.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONThe VHH-based ELISA was highly effective in detecting carbaryl in cereal samples after simple sample extraction and dilution. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that is harmful to human health. Oryza nivara, a wild rice species, serves as a germplasm pool for various favorable genes that can be used in cultivated rice. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and germplasm related to Cd tolerance in O. nivara, we analyzed one set of introgression lines with a high-density genetic map. Seven QTLs related to Cd tolerance were identified on chromosomes 2, 4, 6, and 8, and an allele of one locus (Bin774) from O. nivara affected two phenotypic traits and was able to increase Cd tolerance in rice. In a further analysis of GeneChip data released by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we explored five candidate genes induced by Cd stress in the QTL region: two oxidoreductase genes (aldo-keto reductase genes LOC_Os04g27060 and LOC_Os04g26920); one terpene synthase gene (LOC_Os04g27190); one cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase gene (LOC_Os04g25060); and one serine carboxypeptidase homolog gene OsSCP23 (LOC_Os04g25560). One Cd-tolerant introgression line (Ra44) was also obtained, with a significantly higher survival rate under Cd stress (93.8%) compared to recipient parent 93-11 (2.3%). Identification of candidate genes and the Cd-tolerant introgression line Ra44 should facilitate further investigation of the mechanism of rice tolerance to Cd contamination.},

   abstract = {The fungus Aspergillus flavus can contaminate maize (Zea mays L.) by producing aflatoxins (AFs), secondary metabolites that have been shown to have adverse health impacts for humans and animals when ingested in large quantities or over extended lengths of time. The FDA strictly regulates that corn contaminated with more than 20 parts per billion (ppb) AFs cannot be marketed for human consumption; therefore, AFs cost US corn growers billions of dollars every year. Current methods to curb aflatoxin contamination in fields involve dense applications of non-aflatoxigenic biological control (biocontrol) strains, either Afla-Guard or AF36, that outcompete native strains and reduce toxicity levels throughout the field. This fungus is heterothallic and sexual reproduction occurs between isolates of opposite mating types, either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2. Both biocontrol strains are of a single mating type MAT1-2. The implications of adding a strain of opposite mating type (MAT1-1) to this formulation are unknown. Here we examine the ability of native non-aflatoxigenic strains applied singly and in combination to reduce AF concentrations in a cornfield in Rocky Mount, NC. We show that native, non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus strains reduced aflatoxin levels and increased yield when compared with untreated controls. Moreover, the strain formulations that included sexually compatible MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 strains showed the greatest reduction in aflatoxin levels. We propose that using a combination of native isolates of opposite mating types reduces AF levels further than current biocontrol agents of a single mating-type strain and could potentially provide a more long-term form of control. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy.},

   abstract = {Grain production and storage are major components in food security. In the ancient times, food security was achieved through gathering of fruits, grains, herbs, tubers, and roots from the forests by individual households. Advancements in human civilization led to domestication of crops and a need to save food for not only a household, but the nation. This extended need for food security led to establishment of national reservoirs for major produces and this practice varies greatly in different states. Each of the applied food production, handling, and storage approaches has its benefits and challenges. In sub-Saharan Africa, several countries have a public funded budget to subsidize production costs, to buy grains from farmers, and to store the produce for a specific period and/or until the next harvests. During the times of famine, the stored grains are later sold at subsidized prices or are given for free to the starving citizens. If there is no famine, the grain is sold to retailers and/or processors (e.g., millers) who later sell it to the consumers. This approach works well if the produce (mainly grain) is stored under conditions that do not favor growth of molds, as some of these microbes could contaminate the grain with toxic and carcinogenic metabolites called mycotoxins. Conditions that alleviate contamination of grains are required during production, handling, and storage. Most of the grain is produced by smallholder farmers under sub-optimal conditions, making it vulnerable to colonization and contamination by toxigenic fungi. Further, the grain is stored in silos at large masses, where it is hard to monitor the conditions at different points of these facilities, and hence, it becomes vulnerable to additional contamination. Production and storage of grain under conditions that favor mycotoxins poses major food health and safety risks to humans and livestock who consume it. This concept paper focuses on how establishment of a local grain production and banking system (LGPBS) could enhance food security and safety in East Africa. The concept of LGPBS provides an extension of advisory and finance support within warehouse receipt system to enhance grain production under optimal conditions. The major practices at the LGPBS and how each could contribute to food security and safety are discussed. While the concept paper gives more strength on maize production and safety, similar practices could be applied to enhance safety of other grains in the same LGPBS.},

   abstract = {Mould infested maize poses a severe problem for farmers, food producers and for consumers worldwide. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by certain mould species that contaminate food and feed. The consumption of these toxins may cause serious health problems for humans and animals. The trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON) constitutes one of the most commonly occurring Fusarium toxins encountered in maize and requires improved methods to limit its entrance into the food and feed system. While a variety of chromatographic and mass spectrometry methods for the identification of such toxins have been established, these are considered time-consuming, cost-intensive and require highly qualified personnel. Alternatively, optical techniques, such as mid-infrared spectroscopy offer rapid detection of fungal infections in cereals and other commodities with minimised sample preparation and analysis time. The present study demonstrates a rapid fungal contamination detection strategy in maize taking advantage of IR-spectroscopy combined with advanced machine learning algorithms. The developed method represents an advancement for the analysis of differences in protein and carbohydrate content revealed in the associated IR-spectra related to the amount of toxin contamination at the European Union (EU) regulatory limits for DON in maize (i.e. 1,250 µg/kg). The employed maize varieties are naturally infected samples or have been infected with Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium graminearum or Fusarium culmorum. Sieved maize samples at the EU regulatory limit were correctly classified using machine learning approaches, therefore enabling the differentiation between DON-contaminated and non-contaminated maize samples. Specifically, a variety of machine learning methods, including Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forests, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) demonstrated excellent classification and validation performance using the obtained IR-spectra. As a result, 183 maize samples of different varieties and infection levels were accurately classified. 94% of the non-contaminated samples and 91% of the contaminated samples were correctly classified using an MLP classification approach. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Essential oils (EOs) are products of plant origin and include mixtures of different chemical compounds. These volatile substances have many interesting properties, including antifungal properties. Fungi may develop under field conditions on crops such as wheat or corn and are able to synthesize mycotoxins, which adversely affect livestock and human health. In the present study, selected EOs were used to inhibit the growth of Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum and reduce the concentrations of mycotoxins in wheat grain. The EOs significantly inhibited the growth of tested Fusarium species (90.99-99.99%), as determined based on ergosterol quantitative analysis. Only the addition of orange oil to F. culmorum exhibits a different inhibition capacity (68.13%). EO application resulted in a large reduction in zearalenone content (99.08-99.99%); only in the case of orange oil application was the reduction estimated at approximately 68.33%. However, all EOs provided a significant reduction in the concentration levels of group B trichothecenes (94.51-100%). It can be concluded that EOs inhibit the growth of fungi of the genus Fusarium and reduce concentration levels of the mycotoxins zearalenone and group B trichothecenes.},

   abstract = {Corn is one of the most cultivated cereals in Brazil. However, its grains are constantly exposed to contamination by mycotoxins. Corn grits are used by the food industry to produce a large variety of corn products such as canjiquinha, a cultural food easily purchased by the Brazilian consumer at low prices. Some studies have demonstrated high contamination of this product by aflatoxins (AFs), representing a potential risk of exposure due to such a contamination. In this study, the efficacy of gaseous ozonation was evaluated on the levels of aflatoxins and on the microbial contamination of corn grits. The application of gaseous ozone was tested in different combinations of exposure time, ozone concentration, and canjiquinha mass. After the ozonation treatment, samples were collected for aflatoxin and microbiological analyses. Aflatoxins were evaluated using a high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) system using pre-column derivatization, and the microbiological analyses were carried out for toxin-producer fungi and mesophilic bacteria. After ozone detoxification, results showed reductions up to 57% in aflatoxin levels. Total fungal count was reduced around 3.0 cycles log CFU g−1 and total mesophilic counts were reduced to non-detectable levels. These results demonstrated that ozonation is an effective alternative for reducing aflatoxin and microbial contamination in products like canjiquinha, thereby improving food safety. © 2019 by the authors.

   abstract = {Background: Breast milk is considered an essential food segment for children up to 6 months; however, it can be contaminated with some mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) as a consequence of ingestion of dietary mycotoxins by lactating mothers. Moreover, the health of infants can be threatened due to simultaneous exposure to a mixture of mycotoxins mainly due to their potential synergistic effects. Scope and approach: An overview of the prevalence of mycotoxins in breast milk and infant formula, fruit- and cereal-based products as routine diets of infants during the last 10 years, besides the associated health risks, were presented. In this regard, the relevant citations published in international databases such as PubMed, Science direct from 2008 to 2019 were screened by the aid of a systematic review approach. Key findings and conclusions: The high prevalence of AFM1 and OTA in breast milk reported in several countries highlighted the extent of mycotoxin occurrence in the diet of lactating mothers. Furthermore, the exposure rates of infants to mycotoxins in breast milk and infant formula while generated a margin of exposure values lower than 10,000, indicating a huge public health concern. Thus, reducing the dietary exposure of mycotoxins for lactating mothers and approaching the required controlling steps during the processing and distribution of infant formulas are crucial. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the health risks to infants due to dietary exposure to multiple mycotoxins in infant foods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Arsenic (As), classified as a "metalloid" element, is well known for its carcinogenicity and other toxic effects to humans. Arsenic exposure in plants results in the alteration of the physiochemical and biological properties and consequently, loss of crop yield. Being a staple food for half of the world's population, the consumption of As-contaminated rice grain by humans may pose serious health issues and risks for food security. In this study, we have described the principal understanding of the molecular basis of arsenic toxicity and accumulation in plant parts. We described the measures for decreasing As accumulation in rice and understanding the mechanism and transport of As uptake, its transport from root to shoot to rice grain, its metabolism, detoxification, as well as the mechanisms lying behind its accumulation in rice grains. There are various checkpoints, such as the tuning of AsV/Pi specific Pi transporters, arsenate reductase, transporters that are involved in the efflux of As to either the vacuole or outside the cell, xylem loading, loading and unloading to the phloem, and transporters involved in the loading of As to grain, that can be targeted to reduce As accumulation in rice grain. Genes/proteins involved in As detoxification, particularly the glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis pathway, phytochelatin (PC) synthesis, and arsenic methyltransferase, also provide a great pool of pathways that can also be castellated for the low As in rice grains. Paddy rice is also used as fodder for animals, enhancing vacuolar sequestration and using constitutive promoters, which may be of concern for animal health. Therefore, using a root-specific promoter and/or converting inorganic arsenic into volatile organic arsenic might be a better strategy for low As in grain. Furthermore, in this review, the other specific approaches, such as bio-remediation, bio-augmentation practices, and molecular breeding, which have great potential to reduce As uptake from soil to rice grains, have also been highlighted. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Triterpenoid saponins are major secondary metabolites in soybean; they are classified into group A and DDMP saponins. Group A saponins cause bitterness and an astringent aftertaste, whereas DDMP saponins are less bitter and more beneficial to human health. Therefore, a need exists for genetic improvement to develop bitter-free soybeans without losing other beneficial saponins. In this study, an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)–induced mutant, PE1327, was isolated and characterized as having a reduced level of group A saponins by chromatography. The PE1327 phenotype, which exhibits no accumulation of group A saponins, resembles that of a previously reported sg-5 wild soybean mutant whose biosynthesis is controlled by the Sg-5 (Glyma.15G243300) gene. The Sg-5 gene sequence in PE1327 revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (G1036A) that causes an amino acid change from Glu346 to Lys346 in the sg-5 protein. Multiple alignment analysis of cytochrome P450 enzymes from numerous organisms revealed that Glu346 is highly conserved in eukaryotes, including plants and animals, but not in prokaryotes. The predicted 3D model of the Sg-5 protein showed that the Glu346 residue is located in the J helix and is likely involved in the linkage between the J and K helices and the stabilization of the J-K loop, suggesting that the amino acid substitution from Glu346 to Lys346 in the PE1327 mutant results in hypofunction of Sg-5. Co-segregation analysis revealed that the Sg-5 locus is tightly linked to reduced group A saponin biosynthesis in PE1327 and that the novel sg-5 variant is recessive to Sg-5. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Effects of Bt rice on S. zeamais and T. elegans have been carefully detected in a laboratory experiment of over 5 years. The survival, development, fecundity, and longevity of the maize weevil were compared between Bt rice and non-Bt rice treatments for every 5 generations from generation 1 to 25. Moreover, the development, adult body size and sex ratio of T. elegans were compared between them parasitizing S. zeamais feeding on Bt rice or non-Bt rice.

   abstract = {Arsenic (As) contamination in subsoil and groundwater is a big problem, especially in many South-East Asian countries. As a staple crop growing under flooded condition in these areas, rice (Oryza sativa L.) becomes a big threat to human health through the food chain since As is highly accumulated in grains. Thus, reducing As accumulation in rice through molecular breeding and identification of rice varieties with low As content are the pressing issues. However, the current understanding on the molecular mechanism of As stress response is still limited for rice. In this study, we performed a comprehensive search for the As-responsive small RNAs (sRNAs) of rice. Briefly, 4,762 and 18,152 sRNAs were identified to be highly activated under As stress in roots and shoots respectively, while 14,603 and 8,308 sRNAs were intensively repressed by As treatment in roots and shoots, respectively. A number of the As-responsive sRNAs found their loci on tRNAs, rRNAs or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Interestingly, these loci preferentially distributed on the 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME halves of the tRNA, rRNA or lncRNA precursors. Among the above-identified As-responsive sRNAs, 252 Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-enriched sRNAs were extracted for target identification, resulting in 200 pairs of sRNA-protein-coding target interactions. Many targets are functionally involved in the development, stress response, reproduction, or lipid metabolism. Additionally, 56 lncRNAs were discovered to be targeted by nine AGO1-enriched sRNAs, indicating the potential involvement of these lncRNAs in As signaling. Taken together, our results could expand the understanding on the non-coding RNA-mediated As stress response in rice.},

   abstract = {TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used in different applications, and potential exposure to these NPs raises concerns about their impact on human health. In contact with biological fluids, proteins adsorb onto NPs to create a protein corona. Protein adsorption is highly dependent on the affinity between exterior amino acid residues and the NP surface. Thus, studying amino acids adsorption onto NPs can provide insight into protein corona formation. Herein, the pH-dependent adsorption of α-amino acids onto TiO2 NPs in buffered solutions is described. Methods include attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to analyze molecular interactions and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure changes in size and zeta-potential upon adsorption. Depending on the predominant speciation and TiO2 NP surface charge, adsorption involves a combination of carboxylate and amine group interactions. Gly and Lys reveal a similar trend of higher adsorption with increasing pH. In contrast, Glu adsorption decreases with increasing pH. Ser adsorption onto TiO2 NPs surfaces is the highest around pHIEP. These differences are attributed to the different speciation of the functional groups within the amino acids and the TiO2 surface charge at each pH. Under our experimental conditions, multiple surface species coexist at different pH values. Protonated surface species are present for all amino acids at pH 2. At pH 9, Lys and Glu adsorbate spectra have new peaks at 1740 cm−1 and 1744 cm−1, respectively. This is a possible result of surface-induced deprotonation of the amine group and proton transfer to the carboxylate. Analyzing the pH-dependent adsorption of amino acids can provide a better understanding of biomolecule-surface interactions in in vivo and different biological milieu. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by several species of Fusarium fungi, which can be predominantly found in agricultural crops such as wheat. In livestock, deoxynivalenol-contaminated grain can produce vomiting, feed refusal, weight loss, and diarrhea. This paper reports an electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of residual DON mycotoxin in food samples. The device uses electrochemical nanoprobes (CdSNP-AbDON) and antigen biofunctionalized magnetic μ-particles (DON-BSAMP) to detect the mycotoxin. CdSNP-AbDON are prepared by labelling the DON-specific antibodies with CdS nanoparticles (CdSNPs). Nanoparticle size and CdSNP-AbDON conjugation ratio are characterized using TEM images. The metal ions released by the CdSNP are reduced at the working electrode and read by anodic stripping voltammetry. DON can be detected in PBST buffer with an IC 50 of 6.74 ± 0.19 μg L −1 . The high detectability of the immunosensor developed allows detection of DON residues in 50-fold diluted wheat extracts. The limit of detection (LOD, IC 90 ) accomplished in wheat is of 342.4 μg kg −1 , which is below the maximum residue limit (MRL, 1750 μg kg −1 for unprocessed durum wheat, 750 μg kg −1 for cereals intended for direct human consumption) established by the EU for this mycotoxin. The working range is in the interval between 610 and 6210 μg kg −1 . The performance of the immunosensor was compared with the ELISA assay. DON naturally contaminated wheat samples were analyzed with the immunosensor, showing acceptable recoveries.

   abstract = {Various models and datasets related to aflatoxins in the maize and dairy production chain have been developed and used but they have not yet been linked with each other. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change on aflatoxin B-1 production in maize and its consequences on aflatoxin M-1 contamination in dairy cow's milk, using a full chain modelling approach. To this end, available models and input data were chained together in a modelling framework. As a case study, we focused on maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands to be fed-as part of dairy cows' compound feed-to dairy cows in the Netherlands. Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B-1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M-1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 mu g/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered. The model framework infrastructure is flexible so that forecasting models for other mycotoxins or other food safety hazards as well as other production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models related to aflatoxin B-1 in maize and related aflatoxin M-1 the dairy production chain to obtain a unique predictive methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product.},

The erosion degree of the beads immersed for 15 and 90 days in a wheat beer was reduced with lower CaCl2 concentrations, higher WIBP amounts and reduced complexation times (CT). The swelling behavior of the beads was influenced by CaCl2, sodium alginate, CT and WIBP concentrations. Best conditions to obtain beads with simultaneously lower swelling (606.7 %) and erosion degree (7.6 %) are: 1.5% sodium alginate, 4% WIBP, 0.26 M calcium chloride and 26 min CT. Beads containing the residue of the wine industry can be considered potential additives for a wheat beer to increase the antioxidant activity of this beverage benefiting the consumer.

   abstract = {This study aimed to assess aflatoxin and fumonisin intake through corn tortilla consumption in Veracruz city. Between October 2013 and February 2015, a total of 120 corn tortilla samples (2 kg samples, 40 samples per year) were randomly collected. Aflatoxins and fumonisins were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector. A probability density function (PDF) was used for describing corn tortilla intake, body weight of the Veracruz city population, mycotoxin content of corn tortilla samples and estimated mycotoxin daily intake. The Monte Carlo method with 10,000 iterations was employed to assess the population exposure risk. The highest level of total aflatoxins (AFT) was 22.17 mu g kg(-1), and 526.6 mu g kg(-1) for fumonisins B-1 plus B-2, with 85% and 90% of contaminated samples respectively. Up to 69.7 % of the population was estimated to consume a higher aflatoxin dose than that recommended by the JECFA (1ng kg(-1) of body weight per day); it was found that the recommended dose was exceeded to a greater extent in the male population, due to higher consumption of corn. The risk of fumonisin intake was less than 5 % due to the low presence and levels of these toxins in corn tortillas. The results suggest that corn tortilla consumers are at dietary risk caused by AFT contamination; this information should be considered when taking action to protect public health.},

   abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) as a carcinogen poses a great threat to food security and public health through plant-derived foods such as rice, the staple for nearly half of the world's population. We have previously reported that overexpression of truncated gene fragments derived from the rice genes OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 could reduce Cd accumulation in transgenic rice. However, we did not test the full length genes due to prior work in Arabidopsis where overexpression of these genes caused seedling lethality. Here, we report on limiting the overexpression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 through the use of the stress- inducible promoter RD29B. However, despite generating 625 putative transformants, only 7 lines survived as T1 seedlings and only 1 line of each overexpressed OsO3L2 or OsO3L3-produced T2 progeny. The T2 homozygotes from these 2 lines showed the same effect of reducing accumulation of Cd in root and shoot as well as in T3 grain. As importantly, the concentrations of essential metals copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were unaffected. Analysis of the expression profile suggested that low Cd accumulation may be due to high expression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 in the root tip region. Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region. It is possible that interaction with histone H2A modifies chromatin to regulate downstream gene expression. © 2018},

   abstract = {Multi-class chemical contaminants, such as pesticides and mycotoxins, are recognized as the major risk factors in agro products. It is thus necessary to develop rapid and simple sensing methods to fulfill the on-site monitoring of multi-class chemical contaminants with different physicochemical properties. Herein, a lateral flow immunoassay via time-resolved fluorescence was developed for the rapid, on-site, simultaneous, and quantitative sensing aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)), zearalenone (ZEA), and chlorothalonil (CTN) in maize and peanut. The sample preparation was optimized to a single step, combining the grinding and extraction. Under optimal conditions, the sensing method lowered the limits of detection (LOD) to 0.16, 0.52, and 1.21 mu g/kg in maize and 0.18, 0.57, and 1.47 mu g/kg in peanut with an analytical range of 0.48-20, 1.56-200, and 3.63-300 mu g/kg for AFB(1), ZEA and CTN, respectively. The protocol could be completed within 15 min, including sample preparation and lateral flow immunoassay. The recovery range was 83.24-110.80%. An excellent correlation was observed between this approach and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for mycotoxins and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for pesticide in maize and peanut. This work could be applied in on-site multi-class sensing for food safety.},

   abstract = {Background Cd is one of the highly toxic heavy metals to most organisms, including humans and plants, and Cd-contaminated rice from China has become a global food safety issue. The early prediction of OsPCR (the plant cadmium resistance protein) which contained a PLAC8 domain was related with the accumulation of Cd in rice. To further understand the biological function of the OsPCR genes on the Cd tolerance and Cd accumulation in rice, we used a low grain-Cd-accumulating rice (xiushui 11) and a high grain-Cd-accumulating rice (xiushui 110) varieties to analyze the relationship between the expression levels of the two most abundant expression genes (OsPCR1 and OsPCR3) and the Cd concentrations in different tissues at different growth periods during Cd stress, and transgenic experiments of OsPCR1 and OsPCR3 were carried out. Results OsPCR1 and OsPCR3 were closely related with Cd accumulation. Overexpression of OsPCR1 and OsPCR3 could not only increase the Cd tolerance, but also decrease the Cd accumulation obviously in different parts of the transgenic rice plants (especially in the rice grains), while the RNAi expression plants showed the opposite results. Conclusions These results indicate that OsPCR1 and OsPCR3 play critical roles in Cd accumulation in rice, which provides a theoretical basis for the safe production of rice.},

   abstract = {Alkylresorcinols (ARs) are beneficial for human health and can be used as biomarkers for whole-grain cereal intake. In previous studies, ARs content in whole-grain flour was determined by milling the seeds into powder, thus destroying their structure. In this paper, we adopted a non-destructive extraction approach. Chloroform and ethyl acetate extraction methods were carried out to extract lipids from the seed surface and whole-grain flour of 36 wheat varieties in China, respectively. GC-MS analysis identified chemical compounds in which ARs were the major compounds for all the samples. The average total content of ARs (624.223 mu g/g) in whole grains was much higher than that on seed surfaces (4.934 mu g/g), with a positive correlation (r = 0.863, p < 0.001) between these two parameters. The results suggested that the total ARs content on the seed surface can be used to predict their content in whole-grain flour. Without affecting the seed germination rate and damaging seed structure, we demonstrate that a non-destructive extraction approach is an appropriate and useful method, facilitating the development of rapid screening methods suitable for use in wheat breeding.},

   abstract = {Contamination of cereal grains by heavy metals is becoming a serious threat to human health, especially in the central regions of China. Herein, we report drastic changes in the supramolecular nanostructures of rice albumins (RAs) after binding with Cu(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed that Cu(II) initiated an immediate precipitation of RAs, whereas Cd(II) and Pb(II) promoted the formation of core-satellite structures with a core of multiple protein particles surrounded by satellite particulates. Fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed an entropy-driven, spontaneous behavior of the binding. Consequently, remarkable helix-sheet transitions of RAs were triggered and macroscopic precipitation occurred due to hydrophobic attraction. Our results may help to understand the binding between heavy metals and cereal ingredients from a hydrocolloid perspective to eventually develop detection and removal strategies to combat heavy metal contamination.},

   abstract = {Cadmium-contaminated rice has been a serious food safety issue in China. In this research, carboxymethyl rice starch (CMS) from cadmium-contaminated rice and native rice was prepared to remove the cadmium in rice. The preparation of native rice starch (NRS) and starch from cadmium-contaminated rice (Cd-CRS) was similar, and carboxymethyl starch was prepared following the same steps. A single factor experiment was performed to obtain the carboxymethyl starch prepared under the optimal conditions. Cadmium content was reduced from 0.38 mg/kg to 0.04 mg/kg after alkalization. The physical properties, including particle size, degree of crystallinity, water absorption and freeze-thaw stability, of NRS and Cd-CRS and their carboxymethyl starches were studied. The results showed that the cadmium was significantly removed after extracting starch from cadmium-contaminated rice by alkalization and carboxymethylation. Then, starch samples and carboxymethyl starch samples were characterized. All results showed no obvious difference between Cd-CMS and NCMS, indicating that carboxymethyl starch from cadmium-contaminated rice could be widely used in both food and nonfood industries.},

The Cd retention in root of Cd-safe rice line D62B plays an important role in its low Cd translocation from root to shoot. To understand the mechanism of Cd retention in root, a hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the subcellular distribution of Cd and the contribution of polysaccharides to Cd binding to the root cell wall of a Cd-safe rice line D62B with a common rice line Luhui17 as a control material. D62B retained more Cd in the root by sequestrated a higher proportion of Cd in the cell wall, further it transferred less Cd to shoot. Close to half of the Cd in the root cell wall of D62B was accumulated in the hemicellulose 1 (HC1), and the proportions of HC1 in it were 1.2–1.7 times higher than these of Luhui17. The proportion of Cd in the pectin showed a dose-dependent increase in two rice lines. D62B contained significantly higher uronic acid concentrations of the pectin and greater pectin methyl esterase (PME) activities than Luhui17 in the root cell wall. These results indicated that a superior Cd binding capacity of the cell wall polysaccharides in D62B played an important role in its Cd retention in root. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this work, the anti-idiotypic nanobody VHH 2-24 was first developed and then, using it as a surrogate standard, a toxin-free enzyme immunoassay for ochratoxin A (OTA) was established. The IC50 value of the VHH 2-24 surrogate standard-based ELISA was 0.097 mu g/mL, with a linear range of 0.027-0.653 mu g/mL. The average recoveries were tested by spike-and-recovery experiments, and ranged from 81.8% to 105.0%. The accuracy of the developed ELISA for detecting OTA was further verified by using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and an excellent correlation was observed. In summary, the toxin-free ELISA established in this study proves the latent use of the anti-idiotypic VHH as a surrogate calibrator for other mycotoxins and highly toxic small molecule analysis to improve assay properties for highly sensitive analyte determination in agricultural products.},

This work proposes an efficient and sensitive method for food security inspection targeting Sudan black B. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is applied to the analysis of trace Sudan black B. It could be detected at concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/L in standard solutions and 0.1 mg/kg in black rice extracts with the SERS method for measurement. The linear relationship between the intensity and concentration could be used for the quantitative detection of Sudan black B. The relation between dyeing time of black rice stained by Sudan black B solution and SERS intensity was studied which indirectly showed the effectiveness of the extraction method we designed. The results of the quantitative analysis reveal the practicability of using this method to detect Sudan black B in black rice. As a rapid and sensitive detection method, SERS can be extended to detect other food products and has a great application prospect in food safety inspection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},
