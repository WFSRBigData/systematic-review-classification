#### Systematic review data

For this project the data of two systematic reviews performed for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) were used: one on cereals[1] and one on leafy greens[2].

The goal of the reviews was the identification of chemical hazards in their respective supply chains. The literature for the systematic reviews was collected from Scopus and Web of Science using search queries defined by experts.

The folders in this directory represent the two systematic reviews and contain the used data. Each folder includes two text files containing the collected literature in a BibTeX format (including the abstract). One text file (X_Relevant.txt) contains the literature that was considered relevant for the systematic review and the other text file (X_NotRelevant.txt) contains the literature that was considered not relevant. The literature on cereals is from the period 2008-2018 and the literature on leafy greens is from 2009-2018. The folder also includes a subfolder "Future_set" containing literature from 2019-2020 in filed in the same format as mentioned above. This set of data was used to see if the models could generalize to future years.
